104-132091-0007,IT WAS A HOT DAY THE SKY WAS VERY BLUE,3.69
104-132091-0008,LIKE GREAT SWANS WENT FLOATING OVER IT TO AND FRO JUST OPPOSITE ME WAS A CLUMP OF GREEN RUSHES WITH DARK VELVETY SPIKES AND AMONG THEM ONE SINGLE TALL RED CARDINAL FLOWER WHICH WAS BENDING OVER THE BROOK,15.81
104-132091-0009,AS IF TO SEE ITS OWN BEAUTIFUL FACE IN THE WATER BUT THE CARDINAL DID NOT SEEM TO BE VAIN THE PICTURE WAS SO PRETTY THAT I SAT A LONG TIME ENJOYING IT SUDDENLY CLOSE TO ME TWO SMALL VOICES BEGAN TO TALK,15.435

104-132091-0011,FOR THEY SAID THE SAME WORDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THESE WERE THE WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T DID DIDN'T,14.56
104-132091-0012,I THINK THEY MUST HAVE REPEATED THEM AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES I GOT UP FROM MY SEAT TO SEE IF I COULD FIND THE SPEAKERS AND SURE ENOUGH THERE ON ONE OF THE CAT TAIL BULRUSHES I SPIED TWO TINY PALE GREEN CREATURES,14.615
104-132091-0013,THEIR EYES SEEMED TO BE WEAK FOR THEY BOTH WORE BLACK GOGGLES THEY HAD SIX LEGS APIECE TWO SHORT ONES TWO NOT SO SHORT AND TWO VERY LONG,11.785
104-132091-0014,THEY BEGAN WALKING UP THE RUSH AND THEN I SAW THAT THEY MOVED EXACTLY LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED GIG IN FACT IF I HADN'T BEEN TOO BIG I THINK I SHOULD HAVE HEARD THEM CREAK AS THEY WENT ALONG,12.85
104-132091-0015,THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SO LONG AS I WAS THERE BUT THE MOMENT MY BACK WAS TURNED THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND IN THE SAME OLD WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T,13.4
104-132091-0016,AS I WALKED HOME I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER KATY A KATY I ONCE KNEW,6.26
104-132091-0017,THIS LITTLE STORY GREW IN MY HEAD AND I RESOLVED TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU I HAVE DONE IT AND IN MEMORY OF MY TWO LITTLE FRIENDS ON THE BULRUSH I GIVE IT THEIR NAME HERE IT IS THE STORY OF WHAT KATY DID,16.215
104-132091-0018,KATY'S NAME WAS KATY CARR SHE LIVED IN THE TOWN OF BURNET WHICH WASN'T A VERY BIG TOWN,6.685
104-132091-0019,ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE WOOD PILES AND BARNS AND AN ICE HOUSE BEHIND WAS A KITCHEN GARDEN SLOPING TO THE SOUTH AND BEHIND THAT A PASTURE WITH A BROOK IN IT,10.37
104-132091-0020,TWO RED ONES A YELLOW ONE WITH SHARP HORNS TIPPED WITH TIN AND A DEAR LITTLE WHITE ONE NAMED DAISY THERE WERE SIX OF THE CARR CHILDREN FOUR GIRLS AND TWO BOYS KATY THE OLDEST WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD,16.06
104-132091-0021,LITTLE PHIL THE YOUNGEST WAS FOUR AND THE REST FITTED IN BETWEEN DOCTOR CARR THEIR PAPA WAS A DEAR KIND BUSY MAN WHO WAS AWAY FROM HOME ALL DAY AND SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT TOO,15.625
104-132091-0022,THE CHILDREN HADN'T ANY MAMMA SHE HAD DIED WHEN PHIL WAS A BABY FOUR YEARS BEFORE MY STORY BEGAN KATY COULD REMEMBER HER PRETTY WELL TO THE REST SHE WAS BUT A SAD SWEET NAME,13.975
104-132091-0023,SPOKEN ON SUNDAY AND AT PRAYER TIMES,2.94
104-132091-0024,IN PLACE OF THIS MAMMA WHOM THEY RECOLLECTED SO DIMLY THERE WAS AUNT IZZIE PAPA'S SISTER WHO CAME TO TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN MAMMA WENT AWAY ON THAT LONG JOURNEY FROM WHICH FOR SO MANY MONTHS,13.55
104-132091-0025,THE LITTLE ONES KEPT HOPING SHE MIGHT RETURN AUNT IZZIE WAS A SMALL WOMAN SHARP FACED AND THIN RATHER OLD LOOKING AND VERY NEAT AND PARTICULAR ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE MEANT TO BE KIND TO THE CHILDREN BUT THEY PUZZLED HER MUCH,15.85
104-132091-0026,BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT A BIT LIKE HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AUNT IZZIE HAD BEEN A GENTLE TIDY LITTLE THING WHO LOVED TO SIT AS CURLY LOCKS DID SEWING LONG SEAMS IN THE PARLOR AND TO HAVE HER HEAD PATTED BY OLDER PEOPLE AND BE TOLD THAT SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL,16.22
104-132091-0027,WHEREAS KATY TORE HER DRESS EVERY DAY HATED SEWING AND DIDN'T CARE A BUTTON ABOUT BEING CALLED GOOD WHILE CLOVER AND ELSIE SHIED OFF LIKE RESTLESS PONIES WHEN ANY ONE TRIED TO PAT THEIR HEADS IT WAS VERY PERPLEXING TO AUNT IZZIE,16.38
104-132091-0028,AND ENCOURAGED CLIMBING AND ROUGH PLAYS IN SPITE OF THE BUMPS AND RAGGED CLOTHES WHICH RESULTED IN FACT THERE WAS JUST ONE HALF HOUR OF THE DAY WHEN AUNT IZZIE WAS REALLY SATISFIED ABOUT HER CHARGES AND THAT WAS THE HALF HOUR BEFORE BREAKFAST,15.2
104-132091-0029,AT THIS TIME SHE LOOKED AT THEM WITH PLEASED EYES THEY WERE ALL SO SPICK AND SPAN WITH SUCH NICELY BRUSHED JACKETS AND SUCH NEATLY COMBED HAIR BUT THE MOMENT THE BELL RANG HER COMFORT WAS OVER FROM THAT TIME ON,15.01
104-132091-0030,THEY WERE WHAT SHE CALLED NOT FIT TO BE SEEN THE NEIGHBORS PITIED HER VERY MUCH,5.985
104-132091-0031,AND SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT A SIGHT OF WASHING THOSE CHILDREN MADE,4.195
104-132091-0032,ALWAYS NEVER AUNTY BOYS AND GIRLS WILL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE LITTLE CARRS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD EVER HAVE A BETTER CHANCE,14.585
104-132091-0033,THAN ONE DAY WHEN FIVE OUT OF THE SIX WERE PERCHED ON TOP OF THE ICE HOUSE LIKE CHICKENS ON A ROOST,5.92
104-132091-0034,IT WAS ONLY A LOW ROOF SET OVER A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND AS IT STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDE YARD IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE SHORTEST ROAD TO EVERY PLACE WAS UP ONE OF ITS SLOPES AND DOWN THE OTHER,12.82
104-132091-0035,AND THEN STILL KEEPING THE SITTING POSITION TO LET GO,3.97
104-132091-0036,SHOES AND TROUSERS AND CLOTHES GENERALLY WERE AUNT IZZIE'S AFFAIR THEIRS WAS TO SLIDE AND ENJOY THEMSELVES CLOVER NEXT IN AGE TO KATY,10.725
104-132091-0037,SHE WAS A FAIR SWEET DUMPLING OF A GIRL WITH THICK PIG TAILS OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR AND SHORT SIGHTED BLUE EYES WHICH SEEMED TO HOLD TEARS JUST READY TO FALL FROM UNDER THE BLUE REALLY CLOVER WAS THE JOLLIEST LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD,14.83
104-132091-0038,CLOVER HELD FAST AND WOULD NOT LET GO DOCTOR CARR WHO WASN'T ATTENDING PARTICULARLY HEARD NOTHING BUT THE PATHETIC TONE OF CLOVER'S VOICE AS SHE SAID,9.87
104-132091-0039,ME WANT DOLLY AND WITHOUT STOPPING TO INQUIRE HE CALLED OUT SHARPLY FOR SHAME KATY GIVE YOUR SISTER HER DOLL AT ONCE WHICH KATY MUCH SURPRISED DID WHILE CLOVER PURRED IN TRIUMPH,15.37
104-132091-0040,LIKE A SATISFIED KITTEN CLOVER WAS SUNNY AND SWEET TEMPERED A LITTLE INDOLENT AND VERY MODEST ABOUT HERSELF THOUGH IN FACT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY CLEVER IN ALL SORTS OF GAMES,13.28
104-132091-0041,EVERYBODY LOVED HER AND SHE LOVED EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY KATY WHOM SHE LOOKED UP TO AS ONE OF THE WISEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD PRETTY LITTLE PHIL SAT NEXT ON THE ROOF TO CLOVER AND SHE HELD HIM TIGHT WITH HER ARM,15.63
104-132091-0042,THEN CAME ELSIE A THIN BROWN CHILD OF EIGHT WITH BEAUTIFUL DARK EYES AND CRISP SHORT CURLS COVERING THE WHOLE OF HER SMALL HEAD POOR LITTLE ELSIE WAS THE ODD ONE AMONG THE CARRS,12.84
104-132091-0043,SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BELONG EXACTLY TO EITHER THE OLDER OR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN THE GREAT DESIRE AND AMBITION OF HER HEART,8.685
104-132091-0044,THEY WERE FOREVER ESTABLISHING IN ALL SORTS OF HIDDEN PLACES BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT ELSIE AND USED TO TELL HER TO RUN AWAY AND PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN WHICH HURT HER FEELINGS VERY MUCH WHEN SHE WOULDN'T RUN AWAY,15.235
104-132091-0045,I AM SORRY TO SAY THEY RAN AWAY FROM HER WHICH AS THEIR LEGS WERE LONGEST IT WAS EASY TO DO,6.835
104-132091-0046,LEFT BEHIND WOULD CRY BITTER TEARS AND AS SHE WAS TOO PROUD TO PLAY MUCH WITH DORRY AND JOHN HER PRINCIPAL COMFORT WAS TRACKING THE OLDER ONES ABOUT AND DISCOVERING THEIR MYSTERIES ESPECIALLY THE POST OFFICES,14.145
104-132091-0047,WHICH WERE HER GREATEST GRIEVANCE HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND QUICK AS A BIRD'S SHE WOULD PEEP AND PEER AND FOLLOW AND WATCH TILL AT LAST IN SOME ODD UNLIKELY PLACE THE CROTCH OF A TREE,13.53
104-132091-0048,OR PERHAPS ON THE VERY TOP STEP OF THE SCUTTLE LADDER SHE SPIED THE LITTLE PAPER BOX WITH ITS LOAD OF NOTES ALL ENDING WITH BE SURE AND NOT LET ELSIE KNOW THEN SHE WOULD SEIZE THE BOX AND MARCHING UP TO WHEREVER THE OTHERS WERE,16.345
104-132091-0049,THERE'S YOUR OLD POST OFFICE BUT FEELING ALL THE TIME JUST LIKE CRYING POOR LITTLE ELSIE IN ALMOST EVERY BIG FAMILY THERE IS ONE OF THESE UNMATED LEFT OUT CHILDREN KATY,14.075
104-132091-0050,AND OF USE NEVER SAW AS SHE DRIFTED ON HER HEEDLESS WAY THAT HERE IN THIS LONELY LITTLE SISTER WAS THE VERY CHANCE SHE WANTED FOR BEING A COMFORT TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDED COMFORT VERY MUCH SHE NEVER SAW IT,14.905

104-132091-0057,THE YARDS OF THE HOUSES WERE ONLY SEPARATED BY A GREEN HEDGE WITH NO GATE SO THAT CECY SPENT TWO THIRDS OF HER TIME AT DOCTOR CARR'S,8.335

111-129000-0007,HE WISHED TO GO PIRATING AGAIN AND SAW A WAY OF DOING THIS WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD BE FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY OF THE COMMON METHODS IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT KING GEORGE OF ENGLAND,13.285
111-129000-0008,VERY DESIROUS OF BREAKING UP PIRACY ISSUED A PROCLAMATION IN WHICH HE PROMISED PARDON TO ANY PIRATE WHO WOULD APPEAR BEFORE THE PROPER AUTHORITIES RENOUNCE HIS EVIL PRACTICES AND TAKE AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE,15.495
111-129000-0009,IT ALSO HAPPENED THAT VERY SOON AFTER THIS PROCLAMATION HAD BEEN ISSUED ENGLAND WENT TO WAR WITH SPAIN BEING A MAN WHO KEPT HIMSELF POSTED IN THE NEWS OF THE WORLD SO FAR AS IT WAS POSSIBLE,14.69
111-129000-0010,BONNET SAW IN THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS A VERY GOOD CHANCE FOR HIM TO PLAY THE PART OF A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING,8.105
111-129000-0011,PIRATICAL CAREER BY RENOUNCING PIRACY,3.495
111-129000-0012,TOOK OATHS AND DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS NECESSARY TO CHANGE HIMSELF FROM A PIRATE CAPTAIN TO A RESPECTABLE COMMANDER,8.03
111-129000-0013,HE WAS A LOYAL AND LAW ABIDING SUBJECT OF GREAT BRITAIN,3.975
111-129000-0014,FOR SAINT THOMAS WHICH WAS A BRITISH NAVAL STATION AND WHERE HE DECLARED HE WAS GOING IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A COMMISSION AS A PRIVATEER NOW THE WILY,14.845
111-129000-0015,OF COURSE IT WOULD NOT DO FOR HIM IN HIS PRESENT RESPECTABLE CAPACITY TO GO ABOUT ENLISTING UNEMPLOYED PIRATES BUT AT THIS POINT FORTUNE AGAIN FAVORED HIM,12.7599375
111-129000-0016,HE KNEW OF A DESERT ISLAND NOT VERY FAR AWAY WHERE BLACKBEARD AT THE END OF HIS LAST CRUISE HAD MAROONED A LARGE PARTY OF HIS MEN THIS HEARTLESS PIRATE HAD NOT WANTED TO TAKE ALL OF HIS FOLLOWERS INTO PORT,15.3750625
111-129000-0017,TO LIVE OR DIE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE BONNET WENT OVER TO THIS ISLAND AND FINDING THE GREATER PART OF THESE MEN STILL SURVIVING HE OFFERED TO TAKE THEM TO SAINT THOMAS IN HIS VESSEL IF THEY WOULD AGREE TO WORK,14.925
111-129000-0018,THE SHIP TO PORT THIS PROPOSITION WAS OF COURSE JOYFULLY ACCEPTED AND VERY SOON THE REVENGE WAS MANNED WITH A COMPLETE CREW OF COMPETENT DESPERADOES,12.92
111-129000-0019,AND AT LAST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR BONNET TO START OUT ON HIS PIRATICAL CRUISE HE RECEIVED INFORMATION WHICH CAUSED HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND,9.375
111-129000-0020,WHOM HE HAD NEVER FORGIVEN FOR THE SHAMEFUL AND TREACHEROUS MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD TREATED HIM WAS STILL ON SHORE ENJOYING HIMSELF BUT HE WAS TOLD BY THE CAPTAIN OF A SMALL TRADING VESSEL THAT THE OLD PIRATE WAS PREPARING FOR ANOTHER CRUISE,15.75
111-129000-0021,AND THAT HE WAS THEN IN OCRACOKE INLET NOW BONNET FOLDED HIS ARMS AND STAMPED HIS FEET UPON THE QUARTER DECK THE TIME HAD COME FOR HIM TO SHOW THAT THE NAME OF HIS VESSEL MEANT SOMETHING,13.985
111-129000-0022,NEVER BEFORE HAD HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENGING HIMSELF ON ANYBODY BUT NOW THAT HOUR HAD ARRIVED HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF UPON BLACKBEARD THE IMPLACABLE BONNET SAILED OUT TO SEA,15.835
111-129000-0023,HE WAS NOT GOING FORTH TO PREY UPON UNRESISTING MERCHANTMEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO PUNISH A BLACK HEARTED PIRATE A FAITHLESS SCOUNDREL WHO HAD NOT ONLY ACTED,13.92
111-129000-0024,BUT HAD BEHAVED MOST DISLOYALLY AND DISRESPECTFULLY TOWARD A FELLOW PIRATE CHIEF IF HE COULD ONCE RUN THE REVENGE ALONGSIDE THE SHIP OF THE PERFIDIOUS BLACKBEARD HE WOULD SHOW HIM WHAT A GREEN HAND COULD DO,16.15
111-129000-0025,WHEN BONNET REACHED OCRACOKE INLET HE WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT,6.08
111-129000-0026,BUT HE DID NOT GIVE UP THE PURSUIT HE MADE HOT CHASE AFTER THE VESSEL OF HIS PIRATE ENEMY KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT IN HOPES OF DISCOVERING SOME SIGNS OF HIM IF THE ENRAGED BONNET,14.61
111-129000-0027,OF TWO ATROCIOUS VILLAINS AND CAPTAIN MAYNARD WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE HONOR OF HAVING SLAIN THE MOST FAMOUS PIRATE OF THE DAY,10.365
111-129000-0028,AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP HE UNDERSTOOD THE USE OF THE SWORD EVEN BETTER PERHAPS THAN BLACKBEARD AND THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IF THE TWO SHIPS HAD COME TOGETHER THEIR RESPECTIVE CREWS,14.72
111-129000-0029,WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THEIR CAPTAINS TO FIGHT OUT THEIR PRIVATE QUARREL WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FOR PIRATES DELIGHT IN A BLOODY SPECTACLE AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO THEM A RARE DIVERSION OF THE KIND,13.5
111-129000-0030,BUT BONNET NEVER OVERTOOK BLACKBEARD AND THE GREAT COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL PIRATES DID NOT TAKE PLACE,7.745
111-129000-0031,FOR A TRACE OR SIGHT OF BLACKBEARD THE BAFFLED BONNET GAVE UP THE PURSUIT,5.52
111-129000-0032,THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO CHANGE THE NAME OF HIS VESSEL IF HE COULD NOT BE REVENGED HE WOULD NOT SAIL IN THE REVENGE CASTING ABOUT IN HIS MIND FOR A GOOD NAME HE DECIDED TO CALL HER THE ROYAL JAMES,15.825
111-129000-0033,HAVING NO INTENTION OF RESPECTING HIS OATHS OR OF KEEPING HIS PROMISES HE THOUGHT THAT AS HE WAS GOING TO BE DISLOYAL HE MIGHT AS WELL BE AS DISLOYAL,11.835
111-129000-0034,BY THE SON OF JAMES THE SECOND WHO WAS A PRETENDER TO THE THRONE,4.64
111-129000-0035,THE NEXT THING HE DID WAS TO CHANGE HIS OWN NAME FOR HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE MATTERS BETTER FOR HIM IF HE SHOULD BE CAPTURED AFTER ENTERING UPON HIS NEW CRIMINAL CAREER SO HE CALLED HIMSELF,13.355
111-129000-0036,CAPTAIN THOMAS BY WHICH NAME HE WAS AFTERWARDS KNOWN WHEN THESE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED HE GATHERED HIS CREW TOGETHER AND ANNOUNCED THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO SAINT THOMAS,14.11
111-129000-0037,TO GET A COMMISSION AS A PRIVATEER HE HAD DETERMINED TO KEEP ON IN HIS OLD MANNER OF LIFE AND THAT HE WISHED THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONLY WAS HE A PIRATE CAPTAIN BUT THAT THEY WERE A PIRATE CREW,15.695
111-129000-0038,A VERY NATURAL THING FOR THE GREEN HAND BONNET TO GIVE UP PIRATING AFTER HE HAD BEEN SO THOROUGHLY SNUBBED BY BLACKBEARD AND THEY HAD NOT SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD EVER THINK AGAIN OF SAILING UNDER A BLACK FLAG,15.45
111-129000-0039,HOWEVER THE CREW'S OPINION OF THE GREEN HAND CAPTAIN HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL CHANGED IN HIS VARIOUS CRUISES,8.265
111-129000-0040,AND COULD NOW GIVE VERY FAIR ORDERS AND HIS FURIOUS PURSUIT OF BLACKBEARD HAD ALSO GIVEN HIM A REPUTATION FOR RECKLESS BRAVERY WHICH HE HAD NOT ENJOYED BEFORE A MAN WHO WAS,15.815
111-129000-0041,CHAFING AND FUMING FOR A CHANCE OF A HAND TO HAND CONFLICT WITH THE GREATEST PIRATE OF THE DAY,7.07
111-129000-0042,FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW MOREOVER THEIR STRUTTING AND STALKING CAPTAIN SO RECENTLY BALKED OF HIS DARK REVENGE WAS A VERY SAVAGE LOOKING MAN AND IT WOULD NOT BE PLEASANT EITHER,13.71
111-129000-0043,TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE UP HIS PIRATICAL INTENTION OR TO DECLINE TO JOIN HIM IN CARRYING IT OUT SO THE WHOLE OF THE CREW MINOR OFFICERS AND MEN CHANGED THEIR MINDS ABOUT GOING TO SAINT THOMAS,16.015
111-129000-0044,AND AGREED TO HOIST THE SKULL AND CROSS BONES AND TO FOLLOW CAPTAIN BONNET WHEREVER HE MIGHT LEAD BONNET NOW CRUISED ABOUT IN GRAND STYLE AND TOOK SOME PRIZES,14.61
111-129000-0045,ON THE VIRGINIA COAST AND THEN WENT UP INTO DELAWARE BAY WHERE HE CAPTURED SUCH SHIPS AS HE WANTED AND ACTED GENERALLY IN THE MOST DOMINEERING AND INSOLENT FASHION ONCE WHEN HE STOPPED NEAR THE TOWN OF LEWES,15.705
111-129000-0046,IN ORDER TO SEND SOME PRISONERS ASHORE HE SENT A MESSAGE TO THE OFFICERS OF THE TOWN TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THEY INTERFERED WITH HIS MEN WHEN THEY CAME ASHORE HE WOULD OPEN FIRE UPON THE TOWN WITH HIS CANNON,14.135
111-129000-0047,AND BLOW EVERY HOUSE INTO SPLINTERS OF COURSE THE CITIZENS HAVING NO WAY OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES WERE OBLIGED TO ALLOW THE PIRATES TO COME ON SHORE AND DEPART UNMOLESTED,12.81
111-129000-0048,THEN AFTER THIS THE BLUSTERING CAPTAIN CAPTURED TWO VALUABLE SLOOPS AND WISHING TO TAKE THEM ALONG WITH HIM WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF TRANSFERRING THEIR CARGOES TO HIS OWN VESSEL,12.54
111-129000-0049,HE LEFT THEIR CREWS ON BOARD AND ORDERED THEM TO FOLLOW HIM WHEREVER HE WENT SOME DAYS AFTER THAT WHEN ONE OF THE VESSELS SEEMED TO BE SAILING AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE BONNET QUICKLY LET HER CAPTAIN KNOW,15.025
111-129000-0050,THAT HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE TRIFLED WITH AND SENT HIM THE MESSAGE THAT IF HE DID NOT KEEP CLOSE TO THE ROYAL JAMES HE WOULD FIRE INTO HIM AND SINK HIM TO THE BOTTOM,12.475
111-129000-0051,AFTER A TIME BONNET PUT INTO A NORTH CAROLINA PORT IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE ROYAL JAMES WHICH WAS BECOMING VERY LEAKY AND SEEING NO IMMEDIATE LEGITIMATE WAY OF GETTING PLANKS AND BEAMS,13.57
111-129000-0052,ENOUGH WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS HE CAPTURED A SMALL SLOOP BELONGING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BROKE IT UP IN ORDER TO GET THE MATERIAL HE NEEDED TO MAKE HIS OWN VESSEL SEAWORTHY,13.945
111-129000-0053,NOW THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST VERY SELDOM INTERFERED WITH PIRATES AS WE HAVE SEEN AND IT IS LIKELY THAT BONNET MIGHT HAVE STAYED IN PORT AS LONG AS HE PLEASED AND REPAIRED AND REFITTED,14.305
111-129000-0054,HIS VESSEL WITHOUT MOLESTATION IF HE HAD BOUGHT AND PAID FOR THE PLANKS AND TIMBER HE REQUIRED BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BOLDLY SEIZING THEIR PROPERTY,10.43
111-129000-0055,AND COMPLAINTS OF BONNET'S BEHAVIOR SPREAD FROM SETTLEMENT TO SETTLEMENT AND IT VERY SOON BECAME KNOWN ALL DOWN THE COAST THAT THERE WAS A PIRATE IN NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS COMMITTING DEPREDATIONS,14.24
111-129000-0056,THERE AND WAS PREPARING TO SET OUT ON A FRESH CRUISE,4.035
111-129000-0057,IT HAD NOT BEEN LONG SINCE BLACKBEARD HAD VISITED THEIR HARBOR AND HAD TREATED THEM WITH SUCH BRUTAL INSOLENCE,7.745
111-129000-0058,COULD PREVENT ANOTHER VISITATION OF THE PIRATES THAT EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE,5.445
111-129000-0059,BE SENT OUT TO MEET THE PIRATES WHO WERE COMING DOWN THE COAST,4.18
123-25081-0000,BUT YET HE WAS EVEN THEN THE COCK OF THE WALK AT TARASCON LET US SHOW WHENCE AROSE THIS SOVEREIGNTY IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS SHOOTING MAD IN THESE PARTS,15.78
123-25081-0001,FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST THE CHASE IS THE LOCAL CRAZE AND SO IT HAS EVER BEEN SINCE THE MYTHOLOGICAL TIMES WHEN THE TARASQUE AS THE COUNTY DRAGON WAS CALLED,13.58
123-25081-0002,FLOURISHED HIMSELF AND HIS TAIL IN THE TOWN MARSHES AND ENTERTAINED SHOOTING PARTIES GOT UP AGAINST HIM SO YOU SEE THE PASSION HAS LASTED A GOODISH BIT IT FOLLOWS THAT,15.68
123-25081-0003,TOGETHER WITH A HURLY BURLY OF HOUNDS CRACKING OF WHIPS AND BLOWING OF WHISTLES AND HUNTING HORNS IT'S SPLENDID TO SEE UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LACK OF GAME AN,15.395
123-25081-0004,ABSOLUTE DEARTH STUPID AS THE BRUTE CREATION IS YOU CAN READILY UNDERSTAND THAT IN TIME IT LEARNT SOME DISTRUST,12.105
123-25081-0005,AND YET THE PRETTY HILLOCKS ARE MIGHTILY TEMPTING SWEET SMELLING AS THEY ARE OF MYRTLE LAVENDER AND ROSEMARY AND THE FINE MUSCATELS PLUMPED OUT WITH SWEETNESS EVEN UNTO BURSTING,15.78
123-25081-0006,AS THEY SPREAD ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RHONE ARE DEUCEDLY TEMPTING TOO TRUE TRUE BUT TARASCON LIES BEHIND ALL THIS AND TARASCON IS DOWN IN THE BLACK BOOKS OF THE WORLD OF FUR AND FEATHER,15.35
123-25081-0007,THE VERY BIRDS OF PASSAGE HAVE TICKED IT OFF ON THEIR GUIDE BOOKS AND WHEN THE WILD DUCKS COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE CAMARGUE IN LONG TRIANGLES,10.435
123-25081-0008,SAVE ONE OLD ROGUE OF A HARE ESCAPED BY MIRACLE FROM THE MASSACRES WHO IS STUBBORNLY DETERMINED TO STICK TO IT ALL HIS LIFE HE IS VERY WELL KNOWN AT TARASCON,13.965
123-25081-0009,AND A NAME HAS BEEN GIVEN HIM RAPID IS WHAT THEY CALL HIM,5.93
123-25081-0010,HAS DOUBLED AY TRIPLED THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY BUT NOBODY HAS YET MANAGED TO LAY HIM LOW AT PRESENT,12.375
123-25081-0011,ONLY TWO OR THREE INVETERATE FELLOWS WORRY THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM THE REST HAVE GIVEN HIM UP AS A BAD JOB AND OLD RAPID HAS LONG AGO PASSED INTO THE LEGENDARY WORLD,13.905
123-25081-0012,ALTHOUGH YOUR TARASCONER IS VERY SLIGHTLY SUPERSTITIOUS NATURALLY AND WOULD EAT COCK ROBINS ON TOAST OR THE SWALLOW WHICH IS OUR LADY'S OWN BIRD FOR THAT MATTER IF HE COULD FIND ANY BUT THAT WON'T DO,15.285
123-25081-0013,THEY GO OUT INTO THE REAL COUNTRY TWO OR THREE LEAGUES FROM TOWN THEY GATHER IN KNOTS OF FIVE OR SIX,8.01
123-25081-0014,EXTRACT FROM THEIR GAME BAGS A GOOD SIZED PIECE OF BOILED BEEF RAW ONIONS A SAUSAGE AND ANCHOVIES AND COMMENCE A NEXT TO ENDLESS SNACK WASHED DOWN WITH ONE OF THOSE NICE RHONE WINES,14.925
123-25081-0015,WHICH SETS A TOPER LAUGHING AND SINGING AFTER THAT WHEN THOROUGHLY BRACED UP THEY RISE WHISTLE THE DOGS TO HEEL SET THE GUNS ON HALF COCK AND GO ON THE SHOOT,16.235
123-25081-0016,ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT EVERY MAN PLUCKS OFF HIS CAP SHIES IT UP WITH ALL HIS MIGHT,7.915
123-25081-0017,ACCORDING TO WHAT HE IS LOADED FOR THE MAN WHO LODGES MOST SHOT IN HIS CAP IS HAILED AS KING OF THE HUNT AND STALKS BACK TRIUMPHANTLY AT DUSK INTO TARASCON,13.2
123-25081-0018,WITH HIS RIDDLED CAP ON THE END OF HIS GUN BARREL AMID ANY QUANTITY OF DOG BARKS AND HORN BLASTS IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT CAP SELLING IS A FINE BUSINESS IN THE TOWN,14.47
123-25081-0019,THERE ARE EVEN SOME HATTERS WHO SELL HUNTING CAPS READY SHOT TORN AND PERFORATED FOR THE BAD SHOTS BUT THE ONLY BUYER KNOWN IS THE CHEMIST BEZUQUET,12.22
123-25081-0020,EVERY SUNDAY MORNING OUT HE WOULD MARCH IN A NEW CAP AND BACK HE WOULD STRUT EVERY SUNDAY EVENING WITH A MERE THING OF SHREDS THE LOFT OF BAOBAB VILLA,14.5
123-25081-0021,AND HAD READ ALL THE HANDBOOKS OF ALL POSSIBLE KINDS OF VENERY FROM CAP POPPING TO BURMESE TIGER SHOOTING THE SPORTSMEN CONSTITUTED HIM THEIR GREAT CYNEGETICAL JUDGE,13.015
123-25081-0022,AND TOOK HIM FOR REFEREE AND ARBITRATOR IN ALL THEIR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR DAILY AT COSTECALDE THE GUNSMITH'S,11.075
123-25083-0000,CHIEFLY TO THE ACCOUNT OF THESE DIVERSE TALENTS,3.31
123-25083-0001,THE BRAVE COMMANDANT BRAVIDA HONORARY CAPTAIN RETIRED IN THE MILITARY CLOTHING FACTORY DEPARTMENT CALLED HIM A GAME FELLOW AND YOU MAY WELL ADMIT THAT THE WARRIOR KNEW ALL ABOUT GAME FELLOWS,13.91
123-25083-0002,HE PLAYED SUCH A CAPITAL KNIFE AND FORK ON GAME OF ALL KINDS SO WAS THE LEGISLATURE ON TARTARIN'S SIDE TWO OR THREE TIMES IN OPEN COURT THE OLD CHIEF JUDGE,13.16
123-25083-0003,LASTLY,1.51
123-25083-0004,HE HAD BECOME THE SWELL BRUISER THE ARISTOCRATIC PUGILIST THE CRACK BULLY OF THE LOCAL CORINTHIANS FOR THE TARASCONERS FROM HIS BUILD BEARING STYLE THAT ASPECT OF A GUARD'S,13.975
123-25083-0005,TRUMPETER'S CHARGER WHICH FEARS NO NOISE HIS REPUTATION AS A HERO COMING FROM NOBODY KNEW WHENCE OR FOR WHAT AND SOME SCRAMBLINGS FOR COPPERS AND A FEW KICKS TO THE LITTLE RAGAMUFFINS BASKING AT HIS DOORWAY,15.365

123-25083-0009,WITH ALL HIS NUMBERLESS PARTS DOUBLE MUSCLES THE POPULAR FAVOUR AND THE SO PRECIOUS ESTEEM OF BRAVE COMMANDANT BRAVIDA EX CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY CLOTHING FACTORY TARTARIN WAS NOT HAPPY,13.925
123-25083-0010,THIS LIFE IN A PETTY TOWN WEIGHED UPON HIM AND SUFFOCATED HIM THE GREAT MAN OF TARASCON WAS BORED IN TARASCON,11.505
123-25083-0011,A WILD ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WHICH DREAMT OF NOTHING BUT BATTLES RACES ACROSS THE PAMPAS MIGHTY BATTUES DESERT SANDS BLIZZARDS AND TYPHOONS IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO GO OUT EVERY SUNDAY TO POP AT A CAP,15.55
123-25083-0012,AND THE REST OF THE TIME TO LADLE OUT CASTING VOTES AT THE GUNMAKER'S,5.38
123-25083-0013,THERE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TEDIUM IN IT TO KILL HIM WITH CONSUMPTION IN VAIN DID HE SURROUND HIMSELF WITH BAOBABS AND OTHER AFRICAN TREES TO WIDEN HIS HORIZON,13.625
123-25083-0014,AND SOME LITTLE TO FORGET HIS CLUB AND THE MARKET PLACE IN VAIN DID HE PILE WEAPON UPON WEAPON AND MALAY KREESE UPON MALAY KREESE IN VAIN DID HE CRAM WITH ROMANCES,13.14
123-25083-0015,ENDEAVOURING LIKE THE IMMORTAL DON QUIXOTE TO WRENCH HIMSELF BY THE VIGOUR OF HIS FANCY OUT OF THE TALONS OF PITILESS REALITY,9.04
123-25083-0016,THE SIGHT OF ALL THE MURDEROUS IMPLEMENTS KEPT HIM IN A PERPETUAL STEW OF WRATH AND EXALTATION HIS REVOLVERS REPEATING RIFLES AND DUCKING GUNS SHOUTED BATTLE BATTLE,15.57

123-25083-0019,AND WITH A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS HEAD HE WOULD TRANSLATE HIS READINGS INTO ACTION AND GOADING HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN VOICE,8.875
123-25083-0020,NOW ONLY LET EM COME THEM WHO WERE THEY TARTARIN DID NOT HIMSELF ANY TOO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THEY WAS ALL THAT SHOULD BE ATTACKED AND FOUGHT WITH,15.4

128-121911-0000,THEN SAID SHE THIS DEBATE ABOUT PROVIDENCE IS AN OLD ONE AND IS VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED BY CICERO IN HIS DIVINATION THOU ALSO HAST LONG AND EARNESTLY PONDERED THE PROBLEM,12.715
128-121911-0001,YET NO ONE HAS HAD DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO FIND A SOLUTION AND THE REASON OF THIS OBSCURITY IS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN REASONING CANNOT COPE,10.175
128-121911-0002,NO SHADOW OF UNCERTAINTY WOULD REMAIN WITH A VIEW OF MAKING THIS AT LAST CLEAR AND PLAIN I WILL BEGIN BY CONSIDERING THE ARGUMENTS BY WHICH THOU ART SWAYED FIRST,12.725
128-121911-0003,I INQUIRE INTO THE REASONS WHY THOU ART DISSATISFIED WITH THE SOLUTION PROPOSED WHICH IS TO THE EFFECT THAT,6.64
128-121911-0004,FOREKNOWLEDGE IS NOT TO BE DEEMED ANY HINDRANCE TO THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL NOW SURELY THE SOLE GROUND ON WHICH THOU ARGUEST THE NECESSITY OF THE FUTURE IS THAT THINGS WHICH ARE FOREKNOWN CANNOT FAIL TO COME TO PASS BUT IF,14.89
128-121911-0005,AS THOU WERT READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST NOW THE FACT OF FOREKNOWLEDGE IMPOSES NO NECESSITY ON THINGS FUTURE WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR SUPPOSING THE RESULTS OF VOLUNTARY ACTION CONSTRAINED TO A FIXED ISSUE SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT,15.075
128-121911-0006,AND TO SEE WHAT FOLLOWS WE ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE ARE WILLED ACTIONS THEN TIED DOWN TO ANY NECESSITY IN THIS CASE CERTAINLY NOT,12.175
128-121911-0007,LET US ASSUME FOREKNOWLEDGE AGAIN BUT WITHOUT ITS INVOLVING ANY ACTUAL NECESSITY THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL I IMAGINE WILL REMAIN IN COMPLETE INTEGRITY BUT,11.995
128-121911-0008,GRANTED BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN NO FOREKNOWLEDGE,6.0
128-121911-0009,FOR A SIGN ONLY INDICATES SOMETHING WHICH IS DOES NOT BRING TO PASS THAT OF WHICH IT IS THE SIGN WE REQUIRE TO SHOW BEFOREHAND THAT ALL THINGS WITHOUT EXCEPTION HAPPEN OF NECESSITY,12.215
128-121911-0010,OTHERWISE IF THERE IS NO SUCH UNIVERSAL NECESSITY NEITHER CAN ANY PRECONCEPTION BE A SIGN OF A NECESSITY WHICH EXISTS NOT,8.225
128-121911-0011,MUST BE DRAWN NOT FROM SIGNS AND LOOSE GENERAL ARGUMENTS BUT FROM SUITABLE AND NECESSARY CAUSES BUT HOW CAN IT BE THAT THINGS FORESEEN SHOULD EVER FAIL TO COME TO PASS,11.265
128-121911-0012,WERE NOT ABOUT TO HAPPEN INSTEAD OF OUR SUPPOSING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD COME TO PASS YET THERE WAS NO NECESSITY INVOLVED IN THEIR OWN NATURE COMPELLING THEIR OCCURRENCE,10.0
128-121911-0013,THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH WE SEE TAKING PLACE BEFORE OUR EYES THE MOVEMENTS OF CHARIOTEERS FOR INSTANCE IN GUIDING AND TURNING THEIR CARS AND SO ON NOW IS ANY ONE OF THESE MOVEMENTS COMPELLED BY ANY NECESSITY NO CERTAINLY NOT,15.69
128-121911-0014,THERE WOULD BE NO EFFICACY IN SKILL IF ALL MOTIONS TOOK PLACE PERFORCE THEN THINGS WHICH IN TAKING PLACE ARE FREE FROM ANY NECESSITY AS TO THEIR BEING IN THE PRESENT MUST ALSO BEFORE THEY TAKE PLACE BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN WITHOUT NECESSITY,16.035
128-121911-0015,WHEREFORE THERE ARE THINGS WHICH WILL COME TO PASS THE OCCURRENCE OF WHICH IS PERFECTLY FREE FROM NECESSITY AT ALL EVENTS I IMAGINE THAT NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THINGS NOW TAKING PLACE WERE ABOUT TO COME TO PASS BEFORE THEY WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING,13.11
128-121911-0016,SUCH THINGS HOWEVER MUCH FOREKNOWN ARE IN THEIR OCCURRENCE FREE,5.37
128-121911-0017,BUT THIS THOU WILT SAY IS THE VERY POINT IN DISPUTE WHETHER ANY FOREKNOWING IS POSSIBLE OF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS NOT NECESSARY FOR HERE THERE SEEMS TO THEE A CONTRADICTION AND IF THEY ARE FORESEEN THEIR NECESSITY FOLLOWS,15.2
128-121911-0018,WHEREAS IF THERE IS NO NECESSITY THEY CAN BY NO MEANS BE FOREKNOWN AND THOU THINKEST THAT NOTHING CAN BE GRASPED AS KNOWN UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN BUT IF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS UNCERTAIN ARE FOREKNOWN AS CERTAIN,13.135
128-121911-0019,THIS IS THE VERY MIST OF OPINION NOT THE TRUTH OF KNOWLEDGE,4.49
128-121911-0020,THOU BELIEVEST TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SOUNDNESS OF KNOWLEDGE NOW THE CAUSE OF THE MISTAKE IS THIS THAT MEN THINK THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS COGNIZED PURELY BY THE NATURE AND EFFICACY OF THE THING KNOWN,14.425
128-121911-0021,WHEREAS THE CASE IS THE VERY REVERSE ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS GRASPED NOT CONFORMABLY TO ITS OWN EFFICACY BUT RATHER CONFORMABLY TO THE FACULTY OF THE KNOWER,10.05
128-121911-0022,THE ROUNDNESS OF A BODY IS RECOGNISED IN ONE WAY BY SIGHT IN ANOTHER BY TOUCH SIGHT LOOKS UPON IT FROM A DISTANCE AS A WHOLE BY A SIMULTANEOUS REFLECTION OF RAYS TOUCH GRASPS THE ROUNDNESS PIECEMEAL,13.19
128-121911-0023,BY CONTACT AND ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE AND BY ACTUAL MOVEMENT ROUND THE PERIPHERY ITSELF MAN HIMSELF LIKEWISE IS VIEWED IN ONE WAY BY SENSE IN ANOTHER BY IMAGINATION IN ANOTHER WAY AGAIN BY THOUGHT,15.785
128-121911-0024,IN ANOTHER BY PURE INTELLIGENCE SENSE JUDGES FIGURE CLOTHED IN MATERIAL SUBSTANCE IMAGINATION FIGURE ALONE WITHOUT MATTER THOUGHT TRANSCENDS THIS AGAIN,12.235
128-121911-0025,THE EYE OF INTELLIGENCE IS YET MORE EXALTED,3.46
128-121911-0026,BY THE PURE FORCE OF THE MIND'S VISION WHEREIN THE MAIN POINT TO BE CONSIDERED IS THIS THE HIGHER FACULTY OF COMPREHENSION EMBRACES THE LOWER WHILE THE LOWER CANNOT RISE TO THE HIGHER FOR SENSE HAS NO EFFICACY BEYOND MATTER,16.015
128-121911-0027,NOR CAN IMAGINATION BEHOLD UNIVERSAL IDEAS NOR THOUGHT EMBRACE PURE FORM BUT INTELLIGENCE LOOKING DOWN AS IT WERE FROM ITS HIGHER STANDPOINT IN ITS INTUITION OF FORM DISCRIMINATES ALSO THE SEVERAL ELEMENTS WHICH UNDERLIE IT,15.36
128-121911-0028,BUT IT COMPREHENDS THEM IN THE SAME WAY AS IT COMPREHENDS THAT FORM ITSELF WHICH COULD BE COGNIZED BY NO OTHER THAN ITSELF,7.94
128-121911-0029,BUT SURVEYING ALL THINGS SO TO SPEAK UNDER THE ASPECT OF PURE FORM BY A SINGLE FLASH OF INTUITION THOUGHT ALSO,8.045
128-121911-0030,EMBRACES IMAGES AND SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMAGINATION OR SENSE,5.15
128-121911-0031,MAN IS A TWO LEGGED ANIMAL ENDOWED WITH REASON THIS IS INDEED A UNIVERSAL NOTION YET NO ONE IS IGNORANT THAT THE THING IS IMAGINABLE AND PRESENTABLE TO SENSE BECAUSE THOUGHT CONSIDERS IT NOT BY IMAGINATION OR SENSE,15.33
128-121911-0032,BUT BY MEANS OF RATIONAL CONCEPTION,2.725
128-121911-0033,IS FOUNDED UPON THE SENSES NEVERTHELESS SURVEYS SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT CALLING IN SENSE NOT IN THE WAY OF SENSE PERCEPTION BUT OF IMAGINATION,9.435
128-121911-0034,THAN THE FACULTY OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY COGNIZE NOR IS THIS STRANGE FOR SINCE EVERY JUDGMENT IS THE ACT OF THE JUDGE IT IS NECESSARY THAT EACH SHOULD ACCOMPLISH ITS TASK BY ITS OWN NOT BY ANOTHER'S POWER,15.1750625
128-121911-0035,COMES A DOCTRINE SAGE THAT DOTH LIKEN LIVING MIND TO A WRITTEN PAGE SINCE ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES THROUGH SENSE GRAVEN BY EXPERIENCE AS SAY THEY THE PEN ITS MARKS CURIOUSLY DOTH TRACE,14.66
128-121911-0036,ON THE SMOOTH UNSULLIED WHITE OF THE PAPER'S FACE SO DO OUTER THINGS IMPRESS IMAGES ON CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IF VERILY THE MIND THUS ALL PASSIVE LIES IF NO LIVING POWER WITHIN ITS OWN FORCE SUPPLIES,15.26
128-121911-0037,IF IT BUT REFLECT AGAIN LIKE A GLASS THINGS FALSE AND VAIN,4.215
128-121911-0038,GRASPS EACH WHOLE THAT SENSE PRESENTS OR BREAKS INTO ELEMENTS SO DIVIDES AND RECOMBINES AND IN CHANGEFUL WISE NOW TO LOW DESCENDS AND NOW TO THE HEIGHT DOTH RISE,12.215
128-121911-0039,LAST IN INWARD SWIFT REVIEW STRICTLY SIFTS THE FALSE AND TRUE OF THESE AMPLE POTENCIES FITTER CAUSE I WEEN WERE MIND'S SELF THAN MARKS IMPRESSED BY THE OUTER SCENE YET THE BODY THROUGH THE SENSE,15.41
128-121911-0040,STIRS THE SOUL'S INTELLIGENCE WHEN LIGHT FLASHES ON THE EYE OR SOUND STRIKES THE EAR MIND AROUSED TO DUE RESPONSE MAKES THE MESSAGE CLEAR,11.46
128-134883-0000,MY DEAR SIR THE FACTS DETAILED IN MY LAST LETTER WILL SATISFY YOU AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INCREASE OF MASS IN AN ANIMAL THAT IS ITS GROWTH IS ACCOMPLISHED,10.265
128-134883-0001,THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE ANIMAL SYSTEM BY SUBSTANCES DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN,4.865
128-134883-0002,THE GRAMINIVORA CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE SUBSTANCES THEIR FOOD MUST CONTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ONE OR MORE OF THEM AND IF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE NOT SUPPLIED DEATH QUICKLY ENSUES,10.865
128-134883-0003,THIS IMPORTANT INQUIRY EXTENDS ALSO TO THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE FOOD OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS IN THE EARLIEST PERIODS OF LIFE FOR THIS FOOD ALSO CONTAINS SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN THE ADULT STATE,12.81
128-134883-0004,THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A FLUID WHICH THE BODY OF THE MOTHER SECRETES IN THE SHAPE OF MILK MILK CONTAINS ONLY ONE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT KNOWN UNDER THE NAME OF CASEINE BESIDES THIS ITS CHIEF INGREDIENTS ARE BUTTER,16.395
128-134883-0005,THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL ITS MUSCULAR FIBRE CELLULAR TISSUE NERVOUS MATTER AND BONES MUST HAVE DERIVED THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT OF MILK THE CASEINE FOR BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO NITROGEN,14.63
128-134883-0006,NOW THE ANALYSIS OF CASEINE HAS LED TO THE RESULT WHICH AFTER THE DETAILS I HAVE GIVEN CAN HARDLY EXCITE YOUR SURPRISE THAT THIS SUBSTANCE ALSO IS IDENTICAL IN COMPOSITION WITH THE CHIEF CONSTITUENTS OF BLOOD FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN,14.445
128-134883-0007,NAY MORE A COMPARISON OF ITS PROPERTIES WITH THOSE OF VEGETABLE CASEINE HAS SHOWN THAT THESE TWO SUBSTANCES ARE IDENTICAL IN ALL THEIR PROPERTIES INSOMUCH THAT CERTAIN PLANTS SUCH AS PEAS BEANS AND LENTILS ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE SAME SUBSTANCE,15.61
128-134883-0008,WHICH IS FORMED FROM THE BLOOD OF THE MOTHER AND EMPLOYED IN YIELDING THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL THE YOUNG ANIMAL THEREFORE RECEIVES IN THE FORM OF CASEINE,11.335
128-134883-0009,WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED FROM FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN BY ITS GREAT SOLUBILITY AND BY NOT COAGULATING WHEN HEATED THE CHIEF CONSTITUENT OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD TO CONVERT CASEINE INTO BLOOD NO FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IS REQUIRED AND IN THE CONVERSION OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD INTO CASEINE,16.395
128-134883-0010,WHEN CHEMICALLY EXAMINED CASEINE IS FOUND TO CONTAIN A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF THE EARTH OF BONES THAN BLOOD DOES AND THAT IN A VERY SOLUBLE FORM CAPABLE OF REACHING EVERY PART OF THE BODY THUS EVEN IN THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF ITS LIFE,14.785
128-134883-0011,THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN WHICH VITALITY RESIDES IS IN THE CARNIVOROUS ANIMAL DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A SUBSTANCE,7.545
128-134883-0012,WHAT THEN IS THE USE OF THE BUTTER AND THE SUGAR OF MILK HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT THESE SUBSTANCES ARE INDISPENSABLE TO LIFE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO FIXED BASES NO SODA NOR POTASH,13.98
128-134883-0013,SUGAR OF MILK HAS A COMPOSITION CLOSELY ALLIED TO THAT OF THE OTHER KINDS OF SUGAR OF STARCH AND OF GUM ALL OF THEM CONTAIN CARBON AND THE ELEMENTS OF WATER THE LATTER PRECISELY IN THE PROPORTION TO FORM WATER,13.06
128-134883-0014,THERE IS ADDED THEREFORE BY MEANS OF THESE COMPOUNDS TO THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF FOOD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CARBON OR AS IN THE CASE OF BUTTER OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN THAT IS AN EXCESS OF ELEMENTS,13.625
128-134883-0015,WHICH CANNOT POSSIBLY BE EMPLOYED IN THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD,3.17
128-134883-0016,ALREADY CONTAIN EXACTLY THE AMOUNT OF CARBON WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN,6.135
128-134883-0017,WHICH NEITHER GAINS NOR LOSES WEIGHT PERCEPTIBLY FROM DAY TO DAY ITS NOURISHMENT THE WASTE OF ORGANISED TISSUE AND ITS CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN STAND TO EACH OTHER IN A WELL DEFINED AND FIXED RELATION THE CARBON OF THE CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OFF WITH THAT OF THE URINE,15.515
128-134883-0018,THE NITROGEN OF THE URINE AND THE HYDROGEN GIVEN OFF AS AMMONIA AND WATER THESE ELEMENTS TAKEN TOGETHER MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL IN WEIGHT TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES,12.215
128-134883-0019,AND SINCE THESE LAST ARE EXACTLY REPLACED BY THE FOOD TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE FOOD WERE THIS NOT THE CASE THE WEIGHT OF THE ANIMAL COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMAIN UNCHANGED,10.825
128-134883-0020,THIS FACT PRESUPPOSES,2.25
128-134883-0021,MORE INTENSE THAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXISTING TISSUES IF BOTH PROCESSES WERE EQUALLY ACTIVE THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY COULD NOT INCREASE AND WERE THE WASTE BY TRANSFORMATION GREATER THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WOULD DECREASE,15.425
128-134883-0022,NOW THE CIRCULATION IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL IS NOT WEAKER BUT ON THE CONTRARY MORE RAPID THE RESPIRATIONS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND FOR EQUAL BULKS THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN MUST BE GREATER RATHER THAN SMALLER IN THE YOUNG THAN IN THE ADULT ANIMAL,14.35
128-134883-0023,BUT SINCE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED PARTS GOES ON MORE SLOWLY THERE WOULD ENSUE A DEFICIENCY OF THOSE SUBSTANCES,7.49
128-134883-0024,BECAUSE IN THE CARNIVORA NATURE HAS DESTINED THE NEW COMPOUNDS PRODUCED BY THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED PARTS TO FURNISH THE NECESSARY RESISTANCE TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN AND TO PRODUCE ANIMAL HEAT,12.81
128-134883-0025,NO PART OF EITHER OF WHICH CAN YIELD BLOOD FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN ARE DESTINED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AT AN AGE WHEN A GREATER RESISTANCE IS OPPOSED TO THE METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANISMS OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE PRODUCTION OF COMPOUNDS WHICH,15.215
128-134883-0026,IN THE ADULT STATE ARE PRODUCED IN QUANTITY AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESPIRATION THE YOUNG ANIMAL RECEIVES THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD IN THE CASEINE OF THE MILK A METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANS GOES ON FOR BILE AND URINE ARE SECRETED,14.125
128-134883-0027,THE MATERIALS OF THE METAMORPHOSED PARTS ARE GIVEN OFF IN THE FORM OF URINE OF CARBONIC ACID AND OF WATER BUT THE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK ALSO DISAPPEAR THEY CANNOT BE DETECTED IN THE FAECES THE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK ARE GIVEN OUT IN THE FORM OF CARBONIC ACID AND WATER,16.87
128-134883-0028,AND THEIR CONVERSION INTO OXIDISED PRODUCTS FURNISHES THE CLEAREST PROOF THAT FAR MORE OXYGEN IS ABSORBED THAN IS REQUIRED TO CONVERT THE CARBON AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES INTO CARBONIC ACID AND WATER,12.11
128-134883-0029,MUCH LESS CARBON AND HYDROGEN IN THE FORM ADAPTED FOR THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS THAN CORRESPOND TO THE OXYGEN TAKEN UP IN THE LUNGS,8.48
128-134883-0030,AND WOULD NECESSARILY YIELD TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN WERE NOT THE DEFICIENCY OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN SUPPLIED FROM ANOTHER SOURCE THE CONTINUED INCREASE OF MASS OR GROWTH,12.295
128-134883-0031,AND THE FREE AND UNIMPEDED DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL ARE DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN SUBSTANCES WHICH IN THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS HAVE NO OTHER FUNCTION THAN TO PROTECT THE NEWLY FORMED ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN,13.965
128-134883-0032,THE ELEMENTS OF THESE SUBSTANCES UNITE WITH THE OXYGEN THE ORGANS THEMSELVES COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED THAT IS GROWTH OR INCREASE OF MASS IN THE BODY THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN REMAINING THE SAME WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE,15.05
128-134883-0033,THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH NATURE HAS ADDED TO THE FOOD OF THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA SUBSTANCES DEVOID OF NITROGEN,8.6349375
128-134883-0034,WHICH THEIR ORGANISM CANNOT EMPLOY FOR NUTRITION STRICTLY SO CALLED THAT IS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD SUBSTANCES WHICH MAY BE ENTIRELY DISPENSED WITH IN THEIR NOURISHMENT IN THE ADULT STATE,11.5450625
128-134883-0035,IN THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS BIRDS THE WANT OF ALL MOTION IS AN OBVIOUS CAUSE OF DIMINISHED WASTE IN THE ORGANISED PARTS HENCE MILK IS NOT PROVIDED FOR THEM THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS IN THE CARNIVORA THUS PRESENTS ITSELF UNDER TWO DISTINCT FORMS,14.78
128-134883-0036,THEIR EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON A SUPPLY OF SUBSTANCES HAVING A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF SUGAR OF MILK OR CLOSELY RESEMBLING IT EVERYTHING THAT THEY CONSUME AS FOOD CONTAINS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF STARCH GUM OR SUGAR MIXED WITH OTHER MATTERS,15.325
128-134883-0037,THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE VITAL PROCESS OF THE GRAMINIVORA BY THESE SUBSTANCES IS INDICATED IN A VERY CLEAR AND CONVINCING MANNER WHEN WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE VERY SMALL RELATIVE AMOUNT OF THE CARBON,12.2
128-134883-0038,WHICH THESE ANIMALS CONSUME IN THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR FOOD WHICH BEARS NO PROPORTION WHATEVER TO THE OXYGEN ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN AND LUNGS A HORSE FOR EXAMPLE,11.525
128-134883-0039,IF WE NOW CALCULATE,2.09
128-134883-0040,BUT ALONG WITH THIS NITROGEN,2.17
128-134883-0041,WITHOUT GOING FURTHER INTO THE CALCULATION IT WILL READILY BE ADMITTED,4.035
128-134883-0042,THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN CONSUMED AND AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OUT BY THE ANIMAL ARE MUCH GREATER THAN IN THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN MAN BUT AN ADULT MAN CONSUMES DAILY ABUT FOURTEEN OZ OF CARBON,15.445
128-134883-0043,ACCORDING TO WHICH A HORSE EXPIRES SEVENTY NINE OZ DAILY CANNOT BE VERY FAR FROM THE TRUTH,5.675
128-134883-0044,THE HORSE RECEIVES RATHER LESS THAN THE FIFTH PART OF THE CARBON WHICH HIS ORGANISM REQUIRES FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AND WE SEE THAT THE WISDOM OF THE CREATOR HAS ADDED TO HIS FOOD THE FOUR FIFTHS WHICH ARE WANTING,12.315
128-134883-0045,IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN THE SYSTEM OF THE GRAMINIVORA WHOSE FOOD CONTAINS SO SMALL A PORTION RELATIVELY OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD THE PROCESS OF METAMORPHOSIS IN EXISTING TISSUES AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR RESTORATION OR REPRODUCTION,14.16
128-134883-0046,MUST GO ON FAR LESS RAPIDLY THAN IN THE CARNIVORA WERE THIS NOT THE CASE A VEGETATION A THOUSAND TIMES MORE LUXURIANT THAN THE ACTUAL ONE WOULD NOT SUFFICE FOR THEIR NOURISHMENT SUGAR GUM AND STARCH WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT LIFE IN THESE ANIMALS,15.92
128-134883-0047,BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THE PRODUCTS OF THE WASTE OR METAMORPHOSIS OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES,5.195
128-134884-0000,LET ME NOW APPLY THE PRINCIPLES ANNOUNCED IN THE PRECEDING LETTERS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN SPECIES MAN WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD,10.835
128-134884-0001,EVEN MORE WIDELY EXTENDED THAN THE LION AND TIGER BECAUSE WHEN HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY HE KILLS WITHOUT EATING A NATION OF HUNTERS,10.99
128-134884-0002,ON A LIMITED SPACE IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF INCREASING ITS NUMBERS BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT WHICH IS SOON ATTAINED THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION MUST BE OBTAINED FROM THE ANIMALS,12.775
128-134884-0003,OF WHICH ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER CAN LIVE ON THE SPACE SUPPOSED THESE ANIMALS COLLECT FROM PLANTS THE CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR ORGANS AND OF THEIR BLOOD AND YIELD THEM IN TURN TO THE SAVAGES WHO LIVE BY THE CHASE ALONE,14.875
128-134884-0004,THEY AGAIN RECEIVE THIS FOOD UNACCOMPANIED BY THOSE COMPOUNDS DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN WHICH DURING THE LIFE OF THE ANIMALS SERVED TO SUPPORT THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN SUCH MEN,13.49
128-134884-0005,CONFINED TO AN ANIMAL DIET IT IS THE CARBON OF THE FLESH AND OF THE BLOOD WHICH MUST TAKE THE PLACE OF STARCH AND SUGAR,7.95
128-134884-0006,AND WHILE THE SAVAGE WITH ONE ANIMAL,2.425
128-134884-0007,HE WOULD BE COMPELLED IF CONFINED TO FLESH ALONE IN ORDER TO PROCURE THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION DURING THE SAME TIME TO CONSUME FIVE SUCH ANIMALS IT IS EASY TO SEE FROM THESE CONSIDERATIONS,14.76
128-134884-0008,HOW CLOSE THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES THE CULTIVATION OF OUR CROPS HAS ULTIMATELY NO OTHER OBJECT THAN THE PRODUCTION OF A MAXIMUM OF THOSE SUBSTANCES,13.87
128-134884-0009,WHICH ARE ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION AND RESPIRATION IN THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE GRAIN AND OTHER NUTRITIOUS VEGETABLES YIELD US NOT ONLY IN STARCH SUGAR AND GUM THE CARBON WHICH PROTECTS OUR ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF OXYGEN,15.715
128-134884-0010,AND PRODUCES IN THE ORGANISM THE HEAT WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE BUT ALSO IN THE FORM OF VEGETABLE FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE OUR BLOOD FROM WHICH THE OTHER PARTS OF OUR BODY ARE DEVELOPED MAN,15.97
128-134884-0011,WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD RESPIRES LIKE THE CARNIVORA AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MATTERS PRODUCED BY THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED TISSUES AND,9.355
128-134884-0012,HYAENA IN THE CAGES OF A MENAGERIE ARE COMPELLED TO ACCELERATE THE WASTE OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES BY INCESSANT MOTION IN ORDER TO FURNISH THE MATTER NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION SO THE SAVAGE FOR THE VERY SAME OBJECT,14.545
128-134884-0013,IS FORCED TO MAKE THE MOST LABORIOUS EXERTIONS AND GO THROUGH A VAST AMOUNT OF MUSCULAR EXERCISE HE IS COMPELLED TO CONSUME FORCE MERELY IN ORDER TO SUPPLY MATTER FOR RESPIRATION CULTIVATION IS THE ECONOMY OF FORCE,17.225
128-134884-0014,AND WITH GIVEN MEANS TO PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OF FORCE THE UNPROFITABLE EXERTION OF POWER THE WASTE OF FORCE IN AGRICULTURE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY IN SCIENCE OR IN SOCIAL ECONOMY,13.315
128-134884-0015,IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SAVAGE STATE OR OF THE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT I HAVE ALREADY STATED YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT THE SUBSTANCES OF WHICH THE FOOD OF MAN IS COMPOSED MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES,14.895
128-134884-0016,INTO NITROGENISED AND NON NITROGENISED THE FORMER ARE CAPABLE OF CONVERSION INTO BLOOD THE LATTER ARE INCAPABLE OF THIS TRANSFORMATION,11.77
128-134884-0017,OUT OF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD ARE FORMED ALL THE ORGANISED TISSUES THE OTHER CLASS OF SUBSTANCES IN THE NORMAL STATE OF HEALTH,11.215
128-134884-0018,SERVE TO SUPPORT THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION THE FORMER MAY BE CALLED THE PLASTIC ELEMENTS OF NUTRITION THE LATTER ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION AMONG THE FORMER WE RECKON,15.685
128-134884-0019,VEGETABLE FIBRINE VEGETABLE ALBUMEN VEGETABLE CASEINE ANIMAL FLESH ANIMAL BLOOD AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION IN OUR FOOD ARE,15.615
128-134884-0020,FAT PECTINE STARCH BASSORINE GUM WINE CANE SUGAR BEER GRAPE SUGAR SPIRITS SUGAR OF MILK,12.755
128-134884-0021,THE MOST RECENT AND EXACT RESEARCHES HAVE ESTABLISHED AS A UNIVERSAL FACT TO WHICH NOTHING YET KNOWN IS OPPOSED THAT THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF VEGETABLE FOOD,11.46
128-134884-0022,HAVE A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD NO NITROGENISED COMPOUND THE COMPOSITION OF WHICH DIFFERS FROM THAT OF FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE,13.03
128-134884-0023,IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE VITAL PROCESS IN ANIMALS THE ANIMAL ORGANISM UNQUESTIONABLY POSSESSES THE POWER OF FORMING FROM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD,11.59
128-134884-0024,OF THE NERVES AND BRAIN AND OF THE ORGANIC PART OF CARTILAGES AND BONES BUT THE BLOOD MUST BE SUPPLIED TO IT PERFECT IN EVERYTHING BUT ITS FORM THAT IS IN ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION,12.22
128-134884-0025,IF THIS BE NOT DONE A PERIOD IS RAPIDLY PUT TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD AND CONSEQUENTLY TO LIFE THIS CONSIDERATION ENABLES US EASILY TO EXPLAIN HOW IT HAPPENS,12.385
128-134884-0026,THAT THE TISSUES YIELDING GELATINE OR CHONDRINE AS FOR EXAMPLE THE GELATINE OF SKIN OR OF BONES ARE NOT ADAPTED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE VITAL PROCESS FOR THEIR COMPOSITION IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN,12.905
128-134884-0027,IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ELEMENTS OF GELATINE OR OF THOSE TISSUES WHICH CONTAIN IT THE GELATINOUS TISSUES THE GELATINE OF THE BONES THE MEMBRANES THE CELLS AND THE SKIN SUFFER IN THE ANIMAL BODY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OXYGEN AND MOISTURE,15.8
128-134884-0028,A PROGRESSIVE ALTERATION A PART OF THESE TISSUES IS SEPARATED AND MUST BE RESTORED FROM THE BLOOD BUT THIS ALTERATION AND RESTORATION ARE OBVIOUSLY CONFINED WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS,13.795
128-134884-0029,WHILE IN THE BODY OF A STARVING OR SICK INDIVIDUAL THE FAT DISAPPEARS AND THE MUSCULAR TISSUE TAKES ONCE MORE THE FORM OF BLOOD WE FIND THAT THE TENDONS AND MEMBRANES RETAIN THEIR NATURAL CONDITION,12.07
128-134884-0030,AND THE LIMBS OF THE DEAD BODY THEIR CONNECTIONS WHICH DEPEND ON THE GELATINOUS TISSUES ON THE OTHER HAND WE SEE THAT THE GELATINE OF BONES DEVOURED BY A DOG ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS,13.49
128-134884-0031,WHILE ONLY THE BONE EARTH IS FOUND IN HIS EXCREMENTS THE SAME IS TRUE OF MAN WHEN FED ON FOOD RICH IN GELATINE AS FOR EXAMPLE STRONG SOUP THE GELATINE IS NOT TO BE FOUND EITHER IN THE URINE OR IN THE FAECES AND CONSEQUENTLY,15.975
128-134884-0032,MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CHANGE AND MUST HAVE SERVED SOME PURPOSE IN THE ANIMAL ECONOMY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GELATINE MUST BE EXPELLED FROM THE BODY IN A FORM DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH IT WAS INTRODUCED AS FOOD,13.295
128-134884-0033,WHEN WE CONSIDER THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ALBUMEN OF THE BLOOD INTO A PART OF AN ORGAN COMPOSED OF FIBRINE THE IDENTITY IN COMPOSITION OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES RENDERS THE CHANGE EASILY CONCEIVABLE INDEED,13.515
128-134884-0034,NATURAL AND EASILY EXPLAINED ON ACCOUNT OF THIS VERY IDENTITY OF COMPOSITION,5.345
128-134884-0035,THAT GELATINE WHEN TAKEN IN THE DISSOLVED STATE IS AGAIN CONVERTED IN THE BODY INTO CELLULAR TISSUE MEMBRANE AND CARTILAGE,8.095
128-134884-0036,AND FOR THEIR GROWTH AND WHEN THE POWERS OF NUTRITION IN THE WHOLE BODY ARE AFFECTED BY A CHANGE OF THE HEALTH THEN,9.24
128-134884-0037,THE ORGANIC FORCE BY WHICH THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD ARE TRANSFORMED INTO CELLULAR TISSUE AND MEMBRANES MUST NECESSARILY BE ENFEEBLED BY SICKNESS IN THE SICK MAN THE INTENSITY OF THE VITAL FORCE ITS POWER TO PRODUCE METAMORPHOSES,15.7
128-134884-0038,MUST BE DIMINISHED AS WELL IN THE STOMACH AS IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY IN THIS CONDITION THE UNIFORM EXPERIENCE OF PRACTICAL PHYSICIANS SHOWS THAT GELATINOUS MATTERS IN A DISSOLVED STATE EXERCISE A MOST DECIDED INFLUENCE ON THE STATE OF THE HEALTH,16.11
128-134884-0039,GIVEN IN A FORM ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION THEY SERVE TO HUSBAND THE VITAL FORCE JUST AS MAY BE DONE IN THE CASE OF THE STOMACH BY DUE PREPARATION OF THE FOOD IN GENERAL,11.115
128-134884-0040,BRITTLENESS IN THE BONES OF GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMALS IS CLEARLY OWING TO A WEAKNESS IN THOSE PARTS OF THE ORGANISM WHOSE FUNCTION IT IS TO CONVERT THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD INTO CELLULAR TISSUE AND MEMBRANE,11.63
128-134884-0041,AND IF WE CAN TRUST TO THE REPORTS OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE RESIDED IN THE EAST,4.635
133-142924-0000,IT WAS A SOUND VERY LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IT BEGAN SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN WENT FASTER AND FASTER BOOM BOOM BOOM,11.485
133-142924-0001,I CERTAINLY MUST GO OVER AND PAY HIM A CALL AND FIND OUT WHERE MISSUS GROUSE IS MY HOW STRUTTER CAN DRUM PETER PROMPTLY HEADED TOWARDS THAT DISTANT THUNDER,14.21
133-142924-0002,AS HE DREW NEARER TO IT IT SOUNDED LOUDER AND LOUDER PRESENTLY PETER STOPPED TO TRY TO LOCATE EXACTLY THE PLACE WHERE THAT SOUND WHICH NOW WAS MORE THAN EVER LIKE THUNDER WAS COMING FROM,14.855
133-142924-0003,SUDDENLY PETER REMEMBERED SOMETHING I KNOW JUST WHERE HE IS SAID HE TO HIMSELF THERE'S A BIG MOSSY HOLLOW LOG OVER YONDER,11.555
133-142924-0004,AND I REMEMBER THAT MISSUS GROUSE ONCE TOLD ME THAT THAT IS STRUTTER'S THUNDER LOG VERY VERY CAREFULLY PETER STOLE FORWARD MAKING NO SOUND AT ALL,14.055
133-142924-0005,AT LAST HE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE COULD PEEP OUT AND SEE THAT BIG MOSSY HOLLOW LOG SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS STRUTTER THE RUFFED GROUSE WHEN PETER FIRST SAW HIM HE WAS CROUCHED ON ONE END OF THE LOG,13.54
133-142924-0006,OF REDDISH BROWN BLACK AND GRAY FEATHERS HE WAS RESTING SUDDENLY HE STRAIGHTENED UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT,8.47
133-142924-0007,AND SPREAD IT UNTIL IT WAS LIKE AN OPEN FAN ABOVE HIS BACK THE OUTER EDGE WAS GRAY THEN CAME A BROAD BAND OF BLACK FOLLOWED BY BANDS OF GRAY BROWN AND BLACK,14.465
133-142924-0008,HIS REDDISH BROWN WINGS,2.315
133-142924-0009,NEARLY TOUCHED THE LOG HIS FULL BREAST ROUNDED OUT AND WAS BUFF COLOR WITH BLACK MARKINGS HE WAS OF ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE LITTLE BANTAM HENS PETER HAD SEEN IN FARMER BROWN'S,15.51
133-142924-0010,HENYARD IN THE MOST STATELY WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE STRUTTER WALKED THE LENGTH OF THAT MOSSY LOG,10.145
133-142924-0011,GOBBLER THE BIG TURKEY COCK,2.83
133-142924-0012,STRETCHED HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT AND HIS WINGS BEGAN TO BEAT FIRST SLOWLY THEN FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL THEY WERE JUST A BLUR THEY SEEMED TO TOUCH ABOVE HIS BACK BUT WHEN THEY CAME DOWN THEY DIDN'T QUITE STRIKE HIS SIDES,16.07
133-142924-0013,IT WAS THOSE FAST MOVING WINGS THAT MADE THE THUNDER IT WAS SO LOUD THAT PETER ALMOST WANTED TO STOP HIS EARS WHEN IT ENDED,13.64
133-142924-0014,STRUTTER SETTLED DOWN TO REST AND ONCE MORE APPEARED LIKE A BALL OF FLUFFY FEATHERS HIS RUFF WAS LAID FLAT PETER WATCHED HIM THUNDER SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN VENTURED TO SHOW HIMSELF,15.265
133-142924-0015,CRIED PETER AND HE MEANT JUST WHAT HE SAID STRUTTER THREW OUT HIS CHEST PROUDLY THAT IS JUST WHAT MISSUS GROUSE SAYS HE REPLIED I DON'T KNOW OF ANY BETTER THUNDERER,14.805
133-142924-0016,IF I DO SAY IT MYSELF,2.555
133-142924-0017,ASKED PETER EAGERLY ATTENDING TO HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AS A GOOD HOUSEWIFE SHOULD RETORTED STRUTTER PROMPTLY DO YOU MEAN SHE HAS A NEST AND EGGS ASKED PETER,15.805
133-142924-0018,STRUTTER NODDED SHE HAS TWELVE EGGS HE ADDED PROUDLY I SUPPOSE SAID PETER ARTFULLY HER NEST IS SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE ON THE GROUND,12.265
133-142924-0019,IT MAY OR IT MAY NOT BE NEAR HERE DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ME THUNDER AGAIN OF COURSE PETER SAID HE DID AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR STRUTTER TO SHOW OFF PETER STAYED A WHILE LONGER,15.39
133-142924-0020,TO GOSSIP BUT FINDING STRUTTER MORE INTERESTED IN THUNDERING THAN IN TALKING HE ONCE MORE STARTED FOR HOME,8.59
133-142924-0021,ON HIS WAY HE PASSED A CERTAIN BIG TREE ALL AROUND THE GROUND WAS CARPETED WITH BROWN DEAD LEAVES THERE WERE NO BUSHES OR YOUNG TREES THERE,9.575
133-142924-0022,IT WAS THE LAST PLACE IN THE WORLD HE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND ONE WHEN HE WAS WELL PAST THE BIG TREE THERE WAS A SOFT CHUCKLE AND FROM AMONG THE BROWN LEAVES RIGHT AT THE FOOT OF THAT BIG TREE,12.97
133-142924-0023,A HEAD WITH A PAIR OF THE BRIGHTEST EYES WAS RAISED A LITTLE,4.33
133-142924-0024,HE DIDN'T SEE ME AT ALL CHUCKLED MISSUS GROUSE AS SHE SETTLED DOWN ONCE MORE THAT IS WHAT COMES OF HAVING A CLOAK SO LIKE THE COLOR OF THESE NICE BROWN LEAVES,12.51
133-142924-0025,HE ISN'T THE FIRST ONE WHO HAS PASSED ME WITHOUT SEEING ME AT ALL IT IS BETTER THAN TRYING TO HIDE A NEST AND I CERTAINLY AM THANKFUL TO OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR THE CLOAK SHE GAVE ME,12.44
133-142924-0026,IF THEY DO I CERTAINLY WILL HAVE A FAMILY TO BE PROUD OF MEANWHILE PETER HURRIED ON IN HIS USUAL HAPPY GO LUCKY FASHION UNTIL HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST,14.165
133-142924-0027,OUT ON THE GREEN MEADOWS JUST BEYOND HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A BLACK FORM WALKING ABOUT IN A STATELY WAY AND NOW AND THEN PICKING UP SOMETHING IT REMINDED HIM OF BLACKY THE,11.525
133-142924-0028,HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT WASN'T BLACKY BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH SMALLER BEING NOT MORE THAN HALF AS BIG IT'S CREAKER THE GRACKLE,10.245
133-142924-0029,AND I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING CALLED ON HIM THOUGHT PETER AS HE HOPPED OUT AND STARTED ACROSS THE GREEN MEADOWS TOWARDS CREAKER WHAT A SPLENDID LONG TAIL HE HAS I BELIEVE JENNY WREN,15.495
133-142924-0030,HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE BLACKY THE CROW THAT I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHY THEY CALL HIM CROW BLACKBIRD,6.525
133-142924-0031,WHY WHY EE EXCLAIMED PETER RUBBING HIS EYES WITH ASTONISHMENT HE ISN'T JUST BLACK HE'S BEAUTIFUL SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL AND I'VE ALWAYS SUPPOSED HE WAS JUST PLAIN HOMELY BLACK,15.225
133-142924-0032,IT WAS TRUE CREAKER THE GRACKLE WITH THE SUN SHINING ON HIM WAS TRULY BEAUTIFUL HIS HEAD AND NECK HIS THROAT AND UPPER BREAST WERE A SHINING BLUE BLACK WHILE HIS BACK WAS A RICH SHINING BRASSY GREEN,13.9
133-142924-0033,HIS WINGS AND TAIL WERE MUCH LIKE HIS HEAD AND NECK,4.52
133-142924-0034,THIS CHANGING OF COLORS IS CALLED IRIDESCENCE ONE OTHER THING PETER NOTICED AND THIS WAS THAT CREAKER'S EYES WERE YELLOW JUST AT THE MOMENT PETER COULDN'T REMEMBER ANY OTHER BIRD WITH YELLOW EYES,14.68
133-142924-0035,I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO REPLIED CREAKER,2.515
133-142924-0036,BIRDS I WOULD CHANGE COATS WITH,2.895
133-142924-0037,PETER RATHER TIMIDLY CREAKER SHOOK HIS HEAD NOT QUITE SAID HE SHE LIKES PLAIN BLACK BETTER,8.64
133-142924-0038,IN THE SUN AND TO TAKE CARE OF FINE FEATHERS WHERE IS SHE NOW ASKED PETER OVER HOME REPLIED CREAKER PULLING A WHITE GRUB OUT OF THE ROOTS OF THE GRASS WE'VE GOT A NEST OVER THERE,14.085
133-142924-0039,IN ONE OF THOSE PINE TREES ON THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND I EXPECT ANY DAY NOW WE WILL HAVE FOUR HUNGRY BABIES TO FEED I SHALL HAVE TO GET BUSY THEN YOU KNOW I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERY FATHER,14.965
133-142924-0040,SHOULD DO HIS FULL SHARE IN TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY IT DECLARED PETER NODDING HIS HEAD WITH APPROVAL,9.41
133-142924-0041,MAY I ASK YOU A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION CREAKER ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THEM UNLESS I WANT TO RETORTED CREAKER,11.2
133-142924-0042,CREAKER'S YELLOW EYES BEGAN TO TWINKLE THAT IS A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION SAID HE I WON'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY I STEAL EGGS,9.875
133-142924-0043,I SOMETIMES HELP MYSELF TO THE EGGS YOU SEE THE OWNER MIGHT NOT COME BACK AND THEN THOSE EGGS WOULD SPOIL AND THAT WOULD BE A PITY THAT'S NO EXCUSE AT ALL DECLARED PETER I BELIEVE,15.055
133-142924-0044,YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN SAMMY JAY AND BLACKY THE CROW CREAKER CHUCKLED BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE AT ALL OFFENDED JUST THEN HE HEARD MISSUS CREAKER CALLING HIM AND WITH A HASTY,14.76
133-143240-0000,JIMMY MIGHT HAVE MANAGED TO ESCAPE PERHAPS HIS BLACK SKIN WOULD MAKE HIM BE LOOKED UPON AS A FRIEND BUT THE OLD CAPTAIN WHAT ABOUT HIM HE WOULD RETURN,11.825
133-143240-0001,AND BE SEIZED AND KNOCKED ON THE HEAD FOR CERTAIN THE FIERCE RESISTANCE HE WOULD MAKE CERTAINLY WOULD CAUSE HIS DEATH AND I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT,11.775
133-143240-0002,THEN I BEGAN TO THINK OF MY MOTHER AND FATHER HOW I SHOULD HAVE FAILED IN HELPING THEM AND I REMEMBER THINKING WHAT A GOOD JOB IT WAS THAT MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME,15.495
133-143240-0003,BETTER THE LONG ANXIETY I THOUGHT OF WATCHING AND WAITING FOR MY RETURN THAN TO KNOW I HAD BEEN KILLED LIKE THIS BUT I'M NOT KILLED YET I THOUGHT AS THE BLOOD FLUSHED TO MY FACE,16.625
133-143240-0004,IF I CAN I HAD NOT MUCH TIME GIVEN ME TO THINK FOR I WAS DRAGGED TO MY FEET AND OUT INTO A LARGE OPEN PLACE WHERE THERE WERE HUTS AND TREES AND THERE BEFORE ME,14.88
133-143240-0005,LAY THE SEA WITH OUR SCHOONER BUT THE OTHER WAS GONE,4.825
133-143240-0006,I KNEW THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN BURNED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND THEN SUNK I BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FATE OF THE OTHER SCHOONER'S CREW,13.67
133-143240-0007,AND SOMEHOW IT SEEMED THAT THEY DESERVED IT THEN I BEGAN THINKING OF MY OWN FRIENDS AND THEN VERY SELFISHLY NO DOUBT ABOUT MYSELF BUT I HAD LITTLE TIME FOR THOUGHT,16.11
133-143240-0008,BEING HURRIED ALONG AND PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWD OF THE SAVAGES ALL OF WHOM SEEMED TO BE ROLLING THEIR EYES AND LOOKING AT ME AS IF ENJOYING MY POSITION WELL I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,15.875
133-143240-0009,IT IS ENOUGH TO SCARE ANYBODY BUT I'LL TRY AND LET THEM SEE THAT I BELONG TO A SUPERIOR RACE AND WILL NOT SHOW WHAT I FEEL MY EYES KEPT WANDERING ABOUT EAGERLY FIRST TO LOOK WHERE MY COMPANIONS,16.14
133-143240-0010,WERE PLACED BUT AS I SAW NO SIGN OF THEM I BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED SECONDLY TO SEE WHICH WOULD BE THE BEST COURSE TO TAKE IF I RAN FOR MY LIFE FOR I COULD RUN,15.335
133-143240-0011,AND PRETTY SWIFTLY THEN THE HARDY LIFE I HAD LED OUT IN THE BUSH WITH JIMMY FOR MY COMPANION HAD MADE ME LIGHT OF FOOT AND TOLERABLY ENDURING,12.185
133-143240-0012,BUT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME I SAW NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF ESCAPE THERE WERE TOO MANY SAVAGES CLOSE ABOUT ME AND THEY MUST HAVE DIVINED MY IDEAS FOR THEY KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE UPON,14.06
133-143240-0013,EVERY ACT AT FIRST I HAD FELT NUMBED AND COLD MY LEGS AND ARMS ACHED AND WHEN THE BLACKS TOOK OFF THE ROPE THAT THEY HAD BOUND ABOUT MY LIMBS,12.42
133-143240-0014,AND TO MY GREAT JOY I FELT MORE MYSELF AT LAST AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHATTER IT SEEMED THAT A DECISION HAD BEEN COME TO ABOUT ME,14.325
133-143240-0015,AND A TALL BLACK ARMED WITH A WAR CLUB CAME DANCING UP TO ME SWINGING HIS WEAPON ABOUT CHATTERING WILDLY AND AFTER A FEW FEINTS HE MADE A BLOW,13.79
133-143240-0016,AT MY HEAD IF THAT BLOW HAD TAKEN EFFECT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL,7.625
133-143240-0017,BUT I HAD BEEN TOO MUCH WITH MY FRIEND JIMMY NOT TO BE WELL UPON THE ALERT WE HAD OFTEN PLAYED TOGETHER HE LIKE A BIG BOY IN MIMIC FIGHT WHEN HE HAD PRETENDED,15.58
133-143240-0018,AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO CATCH THE SPEAR ON A SHIELD AND TO AVOID BLOWS MADE WITH WADDIES JIMMY'S LESSONS WERE NOT THROWN AWAY I COULD AVOID A THROWN SPEAR THOUGH HELPLESS,14.95
133-143240-0019,LIKE THE BLACK AGAINST BULLETS WHICH HE SAID CAME TOO MUCH FASTER FASTER TO TOP AND AS THE SAVAGE MADE THE BLOW AT ME I FOLLOWED OUT JIMMY'S TACTICS THREW MYSELF FORWARD,13.6
133-143240-0020,STRIKING THE WRETCH RIGHT IN THE CHEST WITH MY HEAD DRIVING HIM BACKWARD AND LEAPING OVER HIM I RAN FOR MY LIFE,9.65
133-143240-0021,THAT MY PURSUERS WERE AS SWIFT OF FOOT AND THAT THOUGH I WAS CLOSE UPON,5.495
133-143240-0022,THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE ME EASILY AND ONCE CAUGHT I KNEW NOW WHAT WAS TO BE MY FATE I BEGAN THINKING OF THE HUNTED HARE AS I RAN ON,13.445
133-143240-0023,CASTING GLANCES BEHIND ME FROM TIME TO TIME AND SEEING THAT,4.285
133-143240-0024,THERE WERE FOUR WHO WERE PRETTY CLOSE UPON MY HEELS ONE OF WHOM HURLED,5.55
133-143240-0025,I WAS PANTING HEAVILY AND A CHOKING SENSATION CAME UPON ME BUT I RACED ON SINCE IT WAS FOR LIFE HOW LONG THE PURSUIT LASTED I CANNOT TELL PERHAPS A MINUTE,14.58
147-125737-0000,ERE THAT I FARTHER IN THIS TALE PACE ME THINKETH IT ACCORDANT TO REASON,4.755

152-183930-0013,FOR HE HAD SOON FOUND THEIR HEADS ALL BUT INVULNERABLE THE QUEEN HAD ATTACKED HIS LEGS AND FEET WITH HER HORRIBLE GRANITE SHOE AND HE WAS SOON DOWN BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL AND STOOD OUT LONGER,13.55
152-183930-0014,THE GOBLINS WOULD HAVE TORN THEM ALL TO PIECES BUT THE KING HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO CARRY THEM AWAY ALIVE AND OVER EACH OF THEM IN TWELVE GROUPS WAS STANDING A KNOT OF GOBLINS WHILE AS MANY AS COULD FIND ROOM WERE SITTING UPON THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES,14.865
152-183930-0015,CURDIE BURST IN DANCING AND GYRATING AND STAMPING AND SINGING LIKE A SMALL INCARNATE WHIRLWIND,6.49
152-183930-0016,THE QUEEN GAVE A HOWL OF RAGE AND DISMAY AND BEFORE SHE RECOVERED HER PRESENCE OF MIND CURDIE HAVING BEGUN WITH THE GROUP NEAREST HIM HAD ELEVEN OF THE KNIGHTS ON THEIR LEGS AGAIN STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE CRIED AS EACH MAN ROSE,14.205
152-183930-0017,AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE HALL WAS NEARLY EMPTY THE GOBLINS RUNNING FROM IT AS FAST AS THEY COULD HOWLING AND SHRIEKING AND LIMPING AND COWERING EVERY NOW AND THEN AS THEY RAN TO CUDDLE THEIR WOUNDED FEET IN THEIR HARD HANDS OR TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE FRIGHTFUL STAMP STAMP OF THE ARMED MEN,16.83
152-183930-0018,AND NOW CURDIE APPROACHED THE GROUP WHICH IN TRUSTING IN THE QUEEN AND HER SHOE KEPT THEIR GUARD OVER THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN,7.7
152-183930-0019,BUT THE QUEEN STOOD IN FRONT LIKE AN INFURIATED CAT WITH HER PERPENDICULAR EYES GLEAMING GREEN AND HER HAIR STANDING HALF UP FROM HER HORRID HEAD HER HEART WAS QUAKING HOWEVER AND SHE KEPT MOVING ABOUT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT WITH NERVOUS APPREHENSION,16.83
152-183930-0020,WHEN CURDIE WAS WITHIN A FEW PACES SHE RUSHED AT HIM MADE ONE TREMENDOUS STAMP AT HIS OPPOSING FOOT WHICH HAPPILY HE WITHDREW IN TIME AND CAUGHT HIM ROUND THE WAIST TO DASH HIM ON THE MARBLE FLOOR BUT JUST AS SHE CAUGHT HIM,13.73
152-183930-0021,HE CAME DOWN WITH ALL THE WEIGHT OF HIS IRON SHOD SHOE UPON HER SKIN SHOD FOOT AND WITH A HIDEOUS HOWL SHE DROPPED HIM SQUATTED ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK HER FOOT IN BOTH HER HANDS MEANWHILE THE REST RUSHED ON THE KING AND THE BODYGUARD SENT THEM FLYING,15.895
152-183930-0022,AND LIFTED THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN WHO WAS ALL BUT PRESSED TO DEATH IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE HE RECOVERED BREATH AND CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE'S THE PRINCESS CRIED CURDIE AGAIN AND AGAIN NO ONE KNEW AND OFF THEY ALL RUSHED IN SEARCH OF HER,15.92
152-183930-0023,THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE THEY WENT BUT NOWHERE WAS SHE TO BE FOUND NEITHER WAS ONE OF THE SERVANTS TO BE SEEN BUT CURDIE WHO HAD KEPT TO THE LOWER PART OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS NOW QUIET ENOUGH BEGAN TO HEAR A CONFUSED SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUBBUB,15.41
152-183930-0024,THE NOISE GREW AS HIS SHARP EARS GUIDED HIM TO A STAIR AND SO TO THE WINE CELLAR IT WAS FULL OF GOBLINS WHOM THE BUTLER WAS SUPPLYING WITH WINE AS FAST AS HE COULD DRAW IT WHILE THE QUEEN AND HER PARTY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE MEN AT ARMS,14.815
152-183930-0025,HARELIP WITH ANOTHER COMPANY HAD GONE OFF TO SEARCH THE HOUSE THEY CAPTURED EVERY ONE THEY MET AND WHEN THEY COULD FIND NO MORE THEY HURRIED AWAY TO CARRY THEM SAFE TO THE CAVERNS BELOW BUT WHEN THE BUTLER WHO WAS AMONGST THEM FOUND THAT THEIR PATH LAY THROUGH THE WINE CELLAR,15.655
152-183930-0026,HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF PERSUADING THEM TO TASTE THE WINE AND AS HE HAD HOPED THEY NO SOONER TASTED THAN THEY WANTED MORE THE ROUTED GOBLINS ON THEIR WAY BELOW JOINED THEM AND WHEN CURDIE ENTERED THEY WERE ALL WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS,14.635
152-183930-0027,IN WHICH WERE VESSELS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FROM SAUCE PAN TO SILVER CUP PRESSING AROUND THE BUTLER WHO SAT AT THE TAP OF A HUGE CASK FILLING AND FILLING CURDIE CAST ONE GLANCE AROUND THE PLACE BEFORE COMMENCING HIS ATTACK,13.77
152-183930-0028,AND SAW IN THE FARTHEST CORNER A TERRIFIED GROUP OF THE DOMESTICS UNWATCHED BUT COWERING WITHOUT COURAGE TO ATTEMPT THEIR ESCAPE AMONGST THEM WAS THE TERROR STRICKEN FACE OF LOOTIE BUT NOWHERE COULD HE SEE THE PRINCESS,13.62
152-183930-0029,SEIZED WITH THE HORRIBLE CONVICTION THAT HARELIP HAD ALREADY CARRIED HER OFF HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM UNABLE FOR WRATH TO SING ANY MORE BUT STAMPING AND CUTTING WITH GREATER FURY THAN EVER,11.68
152-183930-0030,STAMP ON THEIR FEET STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE SHOUTED AND IN A MOMENT THE GOBLINS WERE DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR LIKE RATS AND MICE THEY COULD NOT VANISH SO FAST HOWEVER,12.085
152-183930-0031,BUT THAT MANY MORE GOBLIN FEET HAD TO GO LIMPING BACK OVER THE UNDERGROUND WAYS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT MORNING PRESENTLY HOWEVER THEY WERE REINFORCED FROM ABOVE BY THE KING AND HIS PARTY WITH THE REDOUBTABLE QUEEN AT THEIR HEAD,13.225
152-183930-0032,FINDING CURDIE AGAIN BUSY AMONGST HER UNFORTUNATE SUBJECTS SHE RUSHED AT HIM ONCE MORE WITH THE RAGE OF DESPAIR AND THIS TIME GAVE HIM A BAD BRUISE ON THE FOOT THEN A REGULAR STAMPING FIGHT GOT UP BETWEEN THEM,13.655
152-183930-0033,CURDIE WITH THE POINT OF HIS HUNTING KNIFE KEEPING HER FROM CLASPING HER MIGHTY ARMS ABOUT HIM AS HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING ONCE MORE A GOOD STAMP AT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT BUT THE QUEEN WAS MORE WARY AS WELL AS MORE AGILE THAN HITHERTO,16.07
152-183930-0034,THE REST MEANTIME FINDING THEIR ADVERSARY THUS MATCHED FOR THE MOMENT PAUSED IN THEIR HEADLONG HURRY AND TURNED TO THE SHIVERING GROUP OF WOMEN IN THE CORNER AS IF DETERMINED TO EMULATE HIS FATHER AND HAVE A SUN WOMAN OF SOME SORT TO SHARE HIS FUTURE THRONE,15.445
152-183930-0035,HARELIP RUSHED AT THEM CAUGHT UP LOOTIE AND SPED WITH HER TO THE HOLE SHE GAVE A GREAT SHRIEK AND CURDIE HEARD HER AND SAW THE PLIGHT SHE WAS IN GATHERING ALL HIS STRENGTH HE GAVE THE QUEEN A SUDDEN CUT ACROSS THE FACE WITH HIS WEAPON,14.735
152-183930-0036,CAME DOWN AS SHE STARTED BACK WITH ALL HIS WEIGHT ON THE PROPER FOOT AND SPRUNG TO LOOTIE'S RESCUE THE PRINCE HAD TWO DEFENCELESS FEET AND ON BOTH OF THEM CURDIE STAMPED JUST AS HE REACHED THE HOLE HE DROPPED HIS BURDEN AND ROLLED SHRIEKING INTO THE EARTH,15.89

152-183930-0040,THE RIGHT THING WOULD HAVE BEEN TO TAKE THE KING AND QUEEN PRISONERS AND HOLD THEM HOSTAGES FOR THE PRINCESS BUT THEY WERE SO ANXIOUS TO FIND HER THAT NO ONE THOUGHT OF DETAINING THEM UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE HAVING THUS RESCUED THE SERVANTS THEY SET ABOUT SEARCHING THE HOUSE ONCE MORE,15.32
152-183930-0041,NONE OF THEM COULD GIVE THE LEAST INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PRINCESS LOOTIE WAS ALMOST SILLY WITH TERROR AND ALTHOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO WALK WOULD NOT LEAVE CURDIE'S SIDE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AGAIN HE ALLOWED THE OTHERS TO SEARCH THE REST OF THE HOUSE,15.325
152-183930-0042,WHERE EXCEPT A DISMAYED GOBLIN LURKING HERE AND THERE THEY FOUND NO ONE WHILE HE REQUESTED LOOTIE TO TAKE HIM TO THE PRINCESS'S ROOM,8.735
152-183930-0043,HE FOUND THE BEDCLOTHES TOSSED ABOUT AND MOST OF THEM ON THE FLOOR WHILE THE PRINCESS'S GARMENTS WERE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM WHICH WAS IN THE GREATEST CONFUSION IT WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT THAT THE GOBLINS HAD BEEN THERE,12.525
152-183930-0044,AND CURDIE HAD NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT SHE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AT THE VERY FIRST OF THE INROAD WITH A PANG OF DESPAIR HE SAW HOW WRONG THEY HAD BEEN IN NOT SECURING THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCE,12.025

152-87733-0013,BUT SPARINGLY DURING THE CEREMONY ALL OF WHICH WERE MOSTLY ACCEPTED COSTLY MULTIPLYING AND VARIED WERE THE GIFTS RECEIVED BY IRENE ENOUGH TO MAKE A PRINCESS STARE WITH STARTLING BEWILDERMENT,14.895
152-87733-0014,NONE CAME FROM IRENE'S TUTOR OSCAR OTWELL AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS THE FIRST TO WHOM LADY DILWORTH ADDRESSED AN INVITATION STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY MUCH TO THE ANNOYANCE AND ASTONISHMENT OF HOSTESS ON THE ONE HAND,14.615
152-87733-0015,AND NEVER BETTER EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE PRESENT EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS,4.59

153-126652-0044,IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST,14.59
153-126671-0000,THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE HEATH THURSDAY THE THIRTY FIRST OF AUGUST WAS ONE OF A SERIES OF DAYS DURING WHICH SNUG HOUSES WERE STIFLING AND WHEN COOL DRAUGHTS WERE TREATS,15.65
153-126671-0001,WHEN CRACKS APPEARED IN CLAYEY GARDENS AND WERE CALLED EARTHQUAKES BY APPREHENSIVE CHILDREN WHEN LOOSE SPOKES WERE DISCOVERED IN THE WHEELS OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES AND WHEN STINGING INSECTS HAUNTED THE AIR,15.275
153-126671-0002,THE EARTH AND EVERY DROP OF WATER THAT WAS TO BE FOUND IN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S GARDEN LARGE LEAVED PLANTS OF A TENDER KIND FLAGGED BY TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING RHUBARB BENT DOWNWARD AT ELEVEN,15.94
153-126671-0003,AND EVEN STIFF CABBAGES WERE LIMP BY NOON IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ON THIS DAY THAT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STARTED ACROSS THE HEATH TOWARDS HER SON'S HOUSE TO DO HER BEST IN GETTING RECONCILED WITH HIM AND EUSTACIA,15.735
153-126671-0004,IN CONFORMITY WITH HER WORDS TO THE REDDLEMAN SHE HAD HOPED TO BE WELL ADVANCED IN HER WALK BEFORE THE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS AT ITS HIGHEST BUT AFTER SETTING OUT SHE FOUND THAT THIS WAS NOT TO BE DONE,14.3
153-126671-0005,EVEN THE PURPLE HEATH FLOWERS HAVING PUT ON A BROWNNESS UNDER THE DRY BLAZES OF THE FEW PRECEDING DAYS EVERY VALLEY WAS FILLED WITH AIR LIKE THAT OF A KILN,12.53
153-126671-0006,HAD UNDERGONE A SPECIES OF INCINERATION SINCE THE DROUGHT HAD SET IN,4.95
153-126671-0007,BUT THE PRESENT TORRID ATTACK MADE THE JOURNEY A HEAVY UNDERTAKING FOR A WOMAN PAST MIDDLE AGE AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD MILE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD HIRED FAIRWAY TO DRIVE HER A PORTION AT LEAST OF THE DISTANCE,15.72
153-126671-0008,AS TO GET HOME AGAIN SO SHE WENT ON THE AIR AROUND HER PULSATING SILENTLY AND OPPRESSING THE EARTH WITH LASSITUDE SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY OVERHEAD,13.305
153-126671-0009,SOME IN THE AIR SOME ON THE HOT GROUND AND VEGETATION SOME IN THE TEPID AND STRINGY WATER OF A NEARLY DRIED POOL ALL THE SHALLOWER PONDS HAD DECREASED TO A VAPOROUS MUD,14.355
153-126671-0010,AMID WHICH THE MAGGOTY SHAPES OF INNUMERABLE OBSCURE CREATURES COULD BE INDISTINCTLY SEEN HEAVING AND WALLOWING WITH ENJOYMENT BEING A WOMAN NOT DISINCLINED TO PHILOSOPHIZE,14.995
153-126671-0011,SHE SOMETIMES SAT DOWN UNDER HER UMBRELLA TO REST AND TO WATCH THEIR HAPPINESS FOR A CERTAIN HOPEFULNESS AS TO THE RESULT OF HER VISIT GAVE EASE TO HER MIND AND BETWEEN IMPORTANT THOUGHTS LEFT IT FREE TO DWELL,15.88
153-126671-0012,ON ANY INFINITESIMAL MATTER WHICH CAUGHT HER EYES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TO HER SON'S HOUSE AND ITS EXACT POSITION WAS UNKNOWN TO HER,14.02
153-126671-0013,SHE TRIED ONE ASCENDING PATH AND ANOTHER AND FOUND THAT THEY LED HER ASTRAY RETRACING HER STEPS SHE CAME AGAIN TO AN OPEN LEVEL WHERE SHE PERCEIVED AT A DISTANCE A MAN AT WORK,14.455
153-126671-0014,SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND INQUIRED THE WAY THE LABOURER POINTED OUT THE DIRECTION AND ADDED,8.305
153-126671-0015,MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STRAINED HER EYES AND AT LAST SAID THAT SHE DID PERCEIVE HIM,5.27
153-126671-0016,HE'S GOING TO THE SAME PLACE MA'AM SHE FOLLOWED THE FIGURE INDICATED HE APPEARED OF A RUSSET HUE NOT MORE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SCENE AROUND HIM THAN THE GREEN CATERPILLAR FROM THE LEAF IT FEEDS ON,16.145
153-126671-0017,HIS PROGRESS WHEN ACTUALLY WALKING WAS MORE RAPID THAN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S BUT SHE WAS ENABLED TO KEEP AT AN EQUABLE DISTANCE FROM HIM BY HIS HABIT OF STOPPING WHENEVER HE CAME TO A BRAKE OF BRAMBLES,14.355
153-126671-0018,WHERE HE PAUSED AWHILE ON COMING IN HER TURN TO EACH OF THESE SPOTS SHE FOUND HALF A DOZEN LONG LIMP BRAMBLES WHICH HE HAD CUT FROM THE BUSH DURING HIS HALT AND LAID OUT STRAIGHT BESIDE THE PATH,15.545
153-126671-0019,THEY WERE EVIDENTLY INTENDED FOR FURZE FAGGOT BONDS WHICH HE MEANT TO COLLECT ON HIS RETURN THE SILENT BEING WHO THUS OCCUPIED HIMSELF SEEMED TO BE OF NO MORE ACCOUNT IN LIFE,14.14
153-126671-0020,THAN AN INSECT HE APPEARED AS A MERE PARASITE OF THE HEATH,5.47
153-126671-0021,AS A MOTH FRETS A GARMENT ENTIRELY ENGROSSED WITH ITS PRODUCTS HAVING NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BUT FERN FURZE HEATH LICHENS AND MOSS,13.54
153-126671-0022,THE FURZE CUTTER WAS SO ABSORBED IN THE BUSINESS OF HIS JOURNEY THAT HE NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS LEATHER LEGGED AND GAUNTLETED FORM AT LENGTH BECAME TO HER AS NOTHING MORE THAN A MOVING HANDPOST TO SHOW HER THE WAY,15.23
153-126671-0023,SUDDENLY SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO HIS INDIVIDUALITY BY OBSERVING PECULIARITIES IN HIS WALK IT WAS A GAIT SHE HAD SEEN SOMEWHERE BEFORE AND THE GAIT REVEALED THE MAN TO HER AS THE GAIT OF AHIMAAZ IN THE DISTANT PLAIN,16.02
153-126671-0024,MADE HIM KNOWN TO THE WATCHMAN OF THE KING HIS WALK IS EXACTLY AS MY HUSBAND'S USED TO BE SHE SAID AND THEN THE THOUGHT BURST UPON HER THAT THE FURZE CUTTER WAS HER SON,15.07
153-126671-0025,SHE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO FAMILIARIZE HERSELF WITH THIS STRANGE REALITY SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT CLYM WAS IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING FURZE BUT SHE HAD SUPPOSED THAT HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH THE LABOUR,13.8
153-126671-0026,ONLY AT ODD TIMES BY WAY OF USEFUL PASTIME YET SHE NOW BEHELD HIM AS A FURZE CUTTER AND NOTHING MORE WEARING THE REGULATION DRESS OF THE CRAFT,13.29
153-126671-0027,AND THINKING THE REGULATION THOUGHTS TO JUDGE BY HIS MOTIONS PLANNING A DOZEN HASTY SCHEMES FOR AT ONCE PRESERVING HIM AND EUSTACIA FROM THIS MODE OF LIFE SHE THROBBINGLY FOLLOWED THE WAY AND SAW HIM,15.625
153-126671-0028,ENTER HIS OWN DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF CLYM'S HOUSE WAS A KNOLL AND ON THE TOP OF THE KNOLL A CLUMP OF FIR TREES SO HIGHLY THRUST UP INTO THE SKY THAT THEIR FOLIAGE FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED,15.33
153-126671-0029,AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED,14.85
153-126671-0030,AND SAT DOWN UNDER THEIR SHADE TO RECOVER HERSELF AND TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO BREAK THE GROUND WITH EUSTACIA SO AS NOT TO IRRITATE A WOMAN UNDERNEATH WHOSE APPARENT INDOLENCE LURKED PASSIONS,14.04
153-126671-0031,EVEN STRONGER AND MORE ACTIVE THAN HER OWN THE TREES BENEATH WHICH SHE SAT WERE SINGULARLY BATTERED RUDE AND WILD AND FOR A FEW MINUTES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT DISMISSED THOUGHTS OF HER OWN STORM BROKEN,15.735
153-126671-0032,AND EXHAUSTED STATE TO CONTEMPLATE THEIRS NOT A BOUGH IN THE NINE TREES WHICH COMPOSED THE GROUP BUT WAS SPLINTERED LOPPED AND DISTORTED BY THE FIERCE WEATHER THAT THERE HELD THEM AT ITS MERCY,16.075
153-126671-0033,WHENEVER IT PREVAILED SOME WERE BLASTED AND SPLIT AS IF BY LIGHTNING BLACK STAINS AS FROM FIRE MARKING THEIR SIDES WHILE THE GROUND AT THEIR FEET WAS STREWN WITH DEAD FIR NEEDLES AND HEAPS OF CONES,15.89
153-126671-0034,BLOWN DOWN IN THE GALES OF PAST YEARS THE PLACE WAS CALLED THE DEVIL'S BELLOWS AND IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO COME THERE ON A MARCH OR NOVEMBER NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE FORCIBLE REASONS FOR THAT NAME,16.445
153-126671-0035,ON THE PRESENT HEATED AFTERNOON WHEN NO PERCEPTIBLE WIND WAS BLOWING THE TREES KEPT UP A PERPETUAL MOAN WHICH ONE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE TO BE CAUSED BY THE AIR,13.58
153-126671-0036,HERE SHE SAT FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE ERE SHE COULD SUMMON RESOLUTION TO GO DOWN TO THE DOOR HER COURAGE BEING LOWERED TO ZERO BY HER PHYSICAL LASSITUDE,12.02
153-126671-0037,TO ANY OTHER PERSON THAN A MOTHER IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A LITTLE HUMILIATING THAT SHE THE ELDER OF THE TWO WOMEN SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO MAKE ADVANCES BUT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD WELL CONSIDERED ALL THAT AND SHE ONLY THOUGHT,14.86
153-126671-0038,HOW BEST TO MAKE HER VISIT APPEAR TO EUSTACIA NOT ABJECT BUT WISE FROM HER ELEVATED POSITION THE EXHAUSTED WOMAN COULD PERCEIVE THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND THE GARDEN,15.485
153-126671-0039,AND THE WHOLE ENCLOSURE OF THE LITTLE DOMICILE AND NOW AT THE MOMENT OF RISING SHE SAW A SECOND MAN APPROACHING THE GATE HIS MANNER WAS PECULIAR HESITATING,14.975
153-126671-0040,AND NOT THAT OF A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS OR BY INVITATION HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE WITH INTEREST AND THEN WALKED ROUND AND SCANNED THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF THE GARDEN AS ONE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF SHAKESPEARE,14.39
153-126671-0041,THE PRISON OF MARY STUART OR THE CHATEAU OF HOUGOMONT AFTER PASSING ROUND AND AGAIN REACHING THE GATE HE WENT IN,10.57
153-126671-0042,BUT A MOMENT'S THOUGHT SHOWED HER THAT THE PRESENCE OF AN ACQUAINTANCE WOULD TAKE OFF THE AWKWARDNESS OF HER FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE HOUSE BY CONFINING THE TALK TO GENERAL MATTERS UNTIL SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THEM,14.35
153-126671-0043,SHE CAME DOWN THE HILL TO THE GATE AND LOOKED INTO THE HOT GARDEN THERE LAY THE CAT ASLEEP ON THE BARE GRAVEL OF THE PATH AS IF BEDS RUGS AND CARPETS WERE UNENDURABLE,14.56
153-126671-0044,THE LEAVES OF THE HOLLYHOCKS HUNG LIKE HALF CLOSED UMBRELLAS THE SAP ALMOST SIMMERED IN THE STEMS AND FOLIAGE WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE GLARED LIKE METALLIC MIRRORS,14.7
153-126671-0045,A SMALL APPLE TREE OF THE SORT CALLED RATHERIPE GREW JUST INSIDE THE GATE THE ONLY ONE WHICH THROVE IN THE GARDEN BY REASON OF THE LIGHTNESS OF THE SOIL AND AMONG THE FALLEN APPLES ON THE GROUND BENEATH,14.96
153-126671-0046,WERE WASPS ROLLING DRUNK WITH THE JUICE OR CREEPING ABOUT THE LITTLE CAVES IN EACH FRUIT WHICH THEY HAD EATEN OUT BEFORE STUPEFIED BY ITS SWEETNESS BY THE DOOR LAY CLYM'S FURZE HOOK,15.43
161-121743-0000,FOUND THAT THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN I HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING HUNGRY I WENT OUT AT THE OTHER DOOR INTO THE CLOSE OR FARMYARD AND RAN ACROSS TO THE HOUSE NO ONE WAS THERE,14.995
161-121743-0001,SOMETHING MOVED ME TO CLIMB ON THE FORM AND LOOK OUT OF A LITTLE WINDOW FROM WHICH I COULD SEE THE MANSE AND THE ROAD FROM IT TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS MISSUS MITCHELL COMING TOWARDS THE FARM,14.32
161-121743-0002,I POSSESSED MY WITS SUFFICIENTLY TO RUN FIRST TO KIRSTY'S PRESS AND SECURE A GOOD SUPPLY OF OATCAKE WITH WHICH I THEN SPED LIKE A HUNTED HARE TO HER FORM,11.34
161-121743-0003,I HAD SOON DRAWN THE STOPPER OF STRAW INTO THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE WHERE HEARING NO ONE APPROACH I BEGAN TO EAT MY OATCAKE AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN BEFORE I HAD FINISHED,12.52
161-121743-0004,AND AS I SLEPT I DREAMED MY DREAM THE SUN WAS LOOKING VERY GRAVE AND THE MOON REFLECTED HIS CONCERN THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH ME AT LENGTH THE SUN SHOOK HIS HEAD,13.47
161-121743-0005,ON AN AXIS AND THE MOON THEREUPON SHOOK HERSELF IN RESPONSE THEN THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT IS ENTIRELY MY OWN OPINION AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO TALK,14.155
161-121743-0006,NOT AS MEN CONVERSE BUT BOTH AT ONCE YET EACH LISTENING WHILE EACH SPOKE I HEARD NO WORD BUT THEIR LIPS MOVED MOST BUSILY THEIR EYEBROWS WENT UP,12.905
161-121743-0007,AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED,14.61
161-121743-0008,IT SEEMED AS IF IN THE AGONY OF THEIR TALK THEIR COUNTENANCES WOULD GO TO PIECES FOR THE STARS THEY DARTED ABOUT HITHER AND THITHER GATHERED INTO GROUPS DISPERSED AND FORMED NEW GROUPS,14.285
161-121743-0009,AND HAVING NO FACES YET BUT BEING A SORT OF CELESTIAL TADPOLES INDICATED BY THEIR MOTIONS ALONE THAT THEY TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE QUESTIONS AGITATING THEIR PARENTS SOME OF THEM KEPT DARTING UP AND DOWN THE LADDER OF RAYS,15.915
161-121743-0010,LIKE PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKS IN THE SEA FOAM,4.3
161-121743-0011,I WAS IN DARKNESS BUT NOT IN MY OWN BED WHEN I PROCEEDED TO TURN I FOUND MYSELF HEMMED IN ON ALL SIDES I COULD NOT STRETCH MY ARMS AND THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM FOR MY BODY BETWEEN MY FEET AND MY HEAD,15.81
161-121743-0012,I WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED AT FIRST AND FELT AS IF I WERE BEING SLOWLY STIFLED,6.895
161-121743-0013,I RECALLED THE HORRIBLE SCHOOL,2.34
161-121743-0014,OVER WHOSE DEFEAT HOWEVER I REJOICED WITH THE PRIDE OF A DRAGON SLAYER,5.005
161-121743-0015,BUT WHAT WAS MY DISMAY TO FIND THAT EVEN WHEN MY HAND WENT OUT INTO SPACE NO LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE OPENING WHAT COULD IT MEAN SURELY I HAD NOT GROWN BLIND WHILE I LAY ASLEEP,13.835
161-121743-0016,HURRIEDLY I SHOT OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE STOPPER OF STRAW AND CREPT FROM THE HOLE IN THE GREAT BARN THERE WAS BUT THE DULLEST GLIMMER OF LIGHT I HAD ALMOST SAID THE CLUMSIEST REDUCTION OF DARKNESS,14.125
161-121743-0017,I TUMBLED AT ONE OF THE DOORS RATHER THAN RAN TO IT I FOUND IT FAST,5.58
161-121743-0018,WHICH I COULD DRAW BACK THE OPEN DOOR REVEALED THE DARK NIGHT BEFORE ME WAS THE CORNYARD AS WE CALLED IT FULL OF RICKS HUGE AND VERY POSITIVE ALTHOUGH DIM THEY ROSE BETWIXT ME AND THE SKY,15.68
161-121743-0019,BETWEEN THEIR TOPS I SAW ONLY STARS AND DARKNESS I TURNED AND LOOKED BACK INTO THE BARN IT APPEARED A HORRIBLE CAVE FILLED WITH DARKNESS I REMEMBERED THERE WERE RATS IN IT,13.81
161-121743-0020,EVEN TO GO OUT AT THE OPPOSITE DOOR I FORGOT HOW SOUNDLY AND PEACEFULLY I HAD SLEPT IN IT I STEPPED OUT INTO THE NIGHT WITH THE GRASS OF THE CORN YARD UNDER MY FEET,13.525
161-121743-0021,THE AWFUL VAULT OF HEAVEN OVER MY HEAD AND THOSE SHADOWY RICKS AROUND ME IT WAS A RELIEF TO LAY MY HAND ON ONE OF THEM AND FEEL THAT IT WAS SOLID I HALF GROPED MY WAY THROUGH THEM,15.58
161-121743-0022,AND GOT OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD,2.64
161-121743-0023,BUT HAD IN THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED YEARS GROWN INTO THE GRIMMEST LARGEST MOST GROTESQUE TREES I HAVE EVER SEEN OF THE KIND I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE AFRAID OF THEM EVEN IN THE DAYTIME BUT THEY DID ME NO HURT,16.705
161-121743-0024,ALONE THERE LAY THE AWFULNESS OF IT I HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN WHAT THE NIGHT WAS THE REAL STING OF ITS FEAR LAY IN THIS THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN IT,13.785
161-121743-0025,EVERYBODY BESIDES ME WAS ASLEEP ALL OVER THE WORLD AND HAD ABANDONED ME TO MY FATE WHATEVER MIGHT COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS TO SEIZE ME WHEN I GOT ROUND THE EDGE OF THE STONE WALL,14.225
161-121743-0026,WHICH ON ANOTHER SIDE BOUNDED THE CORN YARD THERE WAS THE MOON CRESCENT AS I SAW HER IN MY DREAM BUT LOW DOWN TOWARDS THE HORIZON AND LYING ALMOST UPON HER ROUNDED BACK SHE LOOKED VERY DISCONSOLATE AND DIM,16.96
161-121743-0027,THE STARS WERE HIGH UP AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THEY DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN AND MOON AT ALL AND THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME YET THERE WAS A GRANDEUR IN MY DESOLATION THAT WOULD HAVE ELEVATED MY HEART BUT FOR THE FEAR,15.89
161-121743-0028,IF I HAD HAD ONE LIVING CREATURE NIGH ME IF ONLY THE STUPID CALF WHOSE DULL SLEEPY LOW STARTLED ME SO DREADFULLY AS I STOOD STARING ABOUT ME,13.84
161-121743-0029,FOR AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT IS NOT DARK THERE ALL NIGHT LONG WHEN THE SKY IS UNCLOUDED AWAY IN THE NORTH WAS THE GREAT BEAR I KNEW THAT CONSTELLATION FOR BY IT ONE OF THE MEN HAD TAUGHT ME TO FIND THE POLE STAR,15.935
161-121743-0030,NEARLY UNDER IT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN CREEPING ROUND BY THE NORTH TOWARDS THE SPOT IN THE EAST WHERE HE WOULD RISE AGAIN,8.45
161-121743-0031,I GAZED AT THAT PALE FADED LIGHT AND ALL AT ONCE I REMEMBERED THAT GOD WAS NEAR ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT GOD IS THEN AS I KNOW NOW AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM THEN WHICH WAS NEITHER MUCH NOR OFTEN,15.465
161-121743-0032,MY IDEA OF HIM WAS NOT LIKE HIM IT WAS MERELY A CONFUSED MIXTURE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FANCIES ABOUT HIM AND MY OWN I HAD NOT LEARNED HOW BEAUTIFUL GOD IS,13.005
161-121743-0033,AND MUST PUNISH THEM TO MAKE THEM GOOD WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN THE SILENT STARRY NIGHT A YET GREATER TERROR SEIZED ME AND I RAN STUMBLING OVER THE UNEVEN FIELD DOES MY READER,15.15
161-121743-0034,WONDER WHITHER I FLED WHITHER SHOULD I FLY BUT HOME TRUE MISSUS MITCHELL WAS THERE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THERE AS WELL EVEN KIRSTY WOULD NOT DO IN THIS TERROR HOME WAS THE ONLY REFUGE,14.455
161-121743-0035,FOR MY FATHER WAS THERE I SPED FOR THE MANSE BUT AS I APPROACHED IT A NEW APPREHENSION LAID HOLD OF MY TREMBLING HEART I WAS NOT SURE BUT I THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS ALWAYS LOCKED AT NIGHT,15.55
161-121743-0036,I DREW NEARER THE PLACE OF POSSIBLE REFUGE ROSE BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE GRASS PLOT IN FRONT OF IT THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN ITS EYES ITS MOUTH WAS CLOSED IT WAS SILENT AS ONE OF THE RICKS,14.92
161-121743-0037,ABOVE IT SHONE THE SPEECHLESS STARS NOTHING WAS ALIVE NOTHING WOULD SPEAK I WENT UP THE FEW ROUGH HEWN GRANITE,9.515
161-121743-0038,I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND ALMOST SICK WITH THE MISERY OF A BEING WHERE NO OTHER BEING WAS TO COMFORT IT I GROPED MY WAY TO MY FATHER'S ROOM WHEN I ONCE HAD MY HAND ON HIS DOOR,13.94
161-121743-0039,THE WARM TIDE OF COURAGE BEGAN AGAIN TO FLOW FROM MY HEART I OPENED THIS DOOR TOO VERY QUIETLY FOR WAS NOT THE DRAGON ASLEEP DOWN BELOW PAPA PAPA I CRIED IN AN EAGER WHISPER,14.655
161-121743-0040,NO VOICE CAME IN REPLY AND THE PLACE WAS YET MORE SILENT THAN THE NIGHT OR THE HALL HE MUST BE ASLEEP I WAS AFRAID TO CALL LOUDER,10.67
161-121743-0041,I STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO FEEL FOR HIM,3.32
161-121743-0042,I CLIMBED UP ON THE BED I FELT ALL ACROSS IT UTTER DESERTION SEIZED MY SOUL MY FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS IT A HORRIBLE DREAM SHOULD I EVER AWAKE,15.03
161-121743-0043,MY HEART SANK TOTALLY WITHIN ME I COULD BEAR NO MORE I FELL DOWN ON THE BED WEEPING BITTERLY AND WEPT MYSELF ASLEEP,8.99
161-121743-0044,AND THE DESOLATION OF THIS NIGHT WAS MY KEY TO THAT DREAM ONCE MORE I AWOKE TO A SENSE OF MISERY AND STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS CRYING PAPA PAPA THE SAME MOMENT I FOUND MY FATHER'S ARMS AROUND ME,15.62
161-121743-0045,HE FOLDED ME CLOSE TO HIM AND SAID HUSH RANALD MY BOY HERE I AM YOU ARE QUITE SAFE I NESTLED AS CLOSE TO HIM AS I COULD GO AND WEPT FOR BLESSEDNESS OH PAPA I SOBBED,15.18
161-121743-0046,I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU AND I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU MY BOY TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BETWEEN MY NARRATIVE AND MY REPLIES TO HIS QUESTIONINGS HE HAD SOON GATHERED THE WHOLE STORY,14.04
161-121743-0047,AND I IN MY TURN LEARNED THE DISMAY OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHEN I DID NOT APPEAR KIRSTY TOLD WHAT SHE KNEW THEY SEARCHED EVERYWHERE BUT COULD NOT FIND ME AND GREAT AS MY MISERY HAD BEEN,13.68
161-121743-0048,MY FATHER'S HAD BEEN GREATER THAN MINE WHILE I STOOD FORSAKEN AND DESOLATE IN THE FIELD THEY HAD BEEN SEARCHING ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER BUT THE HERD HAD HAD AN IDEA AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY SEARCHED THE BARN AND EVERY PLACE THEY COULD THINK OF,16.055
161-121743-0049,FOUND ME FAST ASLEEP ON HIS SO FAST THAT HE UNDRESSED ME AND LAID ME IN THE BED WITHOUT MY ONCE OPENING MY EYES THE MORE STRANGE AS I HAD ALREADY SLEPT SO LONG BUT SORROW IS VERY SLEEPY,16.835
161-121897-0000,INDEED SAID I I SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT NEITHER IS INDEPENDENCE TO BE FOUND IN WEALTH NOR POWER IN SOVEREIGNTY NOR REVERENCE IN DIGNITIES NOR FAME IN GLORY NOR TRUE JOY IN PLEASURES,14.5
161-121897-0001,I SEEM TO HAVE SOME INKLING BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE AT LARGE FROM THEE WHY TRULY THE REASON IS HARD AT HAND,9.65
161-121897-0002,THAT WHICH IS SIMPLE AND INDIVISIBLE BY NATURE HUMAN ERROR SEPARATES AND TRANSFORMS FROM THE TRUE AND PERFECT TO THE FALSE AND IMPERFECT DOST THOU IMAGINE THAT WHICH LACKETH NOTHING CAN WANT POWER,15.5
161-121897-0003,CERTAINLY NOT RIGHT FOR IF THERE IS ANY FEEBLENESS OF STRENGTH IN ANYTHING IN THIS THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE NEED OF EXTERNAL PROTECTION THAT IS SO ACCORDINGLY,14.98
161-121897-0004,THE NATURE OF INDEPENDENCE AND POWER IS ONE AND THE SAME IT SEEMS SO WELL BUT DOST THINK THAT ANYTHING OF SUCH A NATURE AS THIS CAN BE LOOKED UPON WITH CONTEMPT,14.17
161-121897-0005,OR IS IT RATHER OF ALL THINGS MOST WORTHY OF VENERATION NAY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT LET US THEN ADD REVERENCE TO INDEPENDENCE AND POWER,13.485
161-121897-0006,AND CONCLUDE THESE THREE TO BE ONE WE MUST IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH THINKEST THOU THEN THIS COMBINATION OF QUALITIES TO BE OBSCURE AND WITHOUT DISTINCTION,13.85
161-121897-0007,OR RATHER FAMOUS IN ALL RENOWN JUST CONSIDER CAN THAT WANT RENOWN WHICH HAS BEEN AGREED TO BE LACKING IN NOTHING TO BE SUPREME IN POWER,11.44
161-121897-0008,AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN,13.895
161-121897-0009,THAT WE MUST ADMIT THAT RENOWN IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER THREE IT DOES SAID I THAT THEN WHICH NEEDS NOTHING OUTSIDE ITSELF WHICH CAN ACCOMPLISH ALL THINGS IN ITS OWN STRENGTH,14.585
161-121897-0010,HOW ANY SADNESS CAN FIND ENTRANCE INTO SUCH A STATE WHEREFORE I MUST NEEDS ACKNOWLEDGE IT FULL OF JOY AT LEAST IF OUR FORMER CONCLUSIONS ARE TO HOLD THEN FOR THE SAME REASONS,15.44
161-121897-0011,THIS ALSO IS NECESSARY THAT INDEPENDENCE POWER RENOWN REVERENCE AND SWEETNESS OF DELIGHT ARE DIFFERENT ONLY IN NAME BUT IN SUBSTANCE DIFFER NO WISE ONE FROM THE OTHER,14.915
161-121897-0012,IT IS SAID I THIS THEN WHICH IS ONE AND SIMPLE BY NATURE HUMAN PERVERSITY SEPARATES AND IN TRYING TO WIN A PART OF THAT WHICH HAS NO PARTS,12.5
161-121897-0013,SINCE THERE ARE NO PORTIONS BUT ALSO THE WHOLE TO WHICH IT DOES NOT DREAM OF ASPIRING HOW SO SAID I HE WHO TO ESCAPE WANT SEEKS RICHES GIVES HIMSELF NO CONCERN ABOUT POWER,15.85
161-121897-0014,HE PREFERS A MEAN AND LOW ESTATE AND ALSO DENIES HIMSELF MANY PLEASURES DEAR TO NATURE TO AVOID LOSING THE MONEY WHICH HE HAS GAINED BUT AT THIS RATE HE DOES NOT EVEN ATTAIN TO INDEPENDENCE,15.085
161-121897-0015,A WEAKLING VOID OF STRENGTH VEXED BY DISTRESSES MEAN AND DESPISED AND BURIED IN OBSCURITY HE AGAIN WHO THIRSTS ALONE FOR POWER SQUANDERS HIS WEALTH,13.3
161-121897-0016,AND THINKS FAME AND RANK ALIKE WORTHLESS WITHOUT POWER BUT THOU SEEST IN HOW MANY WAYS HIS STATE ALSO IS DEFECTIVE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS THAT HE LACKS NECESSARIES,14.675
161-121897-0017,AND SINCE HE CANNOT RID HIMSELF OF THESE INCONVENIENCES EVEN CEASES TO HAVE THAT POWER WHICH WAS HIS WHOLE END AND AIM IN LIKE MANNER MAY WE CAST UP THE RECKONING IN CASE OF RANK,14.9
161-121897-0018,OF GLORY OR OF PLEASURE FOR SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SEVERALLY IS IDENTICAL WITH THE REST WHOSOEVER SEEKS ANY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS,12.775
161-121897-0019,DOES NOT EVEN LAY HOLD OF THAT ONE WHICH HE MAKES HIS AIM WELL SAID I WHAT THEN SUPPOSE ANYONE DESIRE TO OBTAIN THEM TOGETHER,12.79
161-121897-0020,HE DOES INDEED WISH FOR HAPPINESS AS A WHOLE BUT WILL HE FIND IT IN THESE THINGS WHICH AS WE HAVE PROVED,8.895
161-121897-0021,NAY BY NO MEANS SAID I THEN HAPPINESS MUST CERTAINLY NOT BE SOUGHT IN THESE THINGS WHICH SEVERALLY ARE BELIEVED TO AFFORD SOME ONE OF THE BLESSINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED THEY MUST NOT I ADMIT,15.725
161-121897-0022,NO CONCLUSION COULD BE MORE TRUE SO THEN THE FORM AND THE CAUSES OF FALSE HAPPINESS ARE SET BEFORE THINE EYES NOW TURN THY GAZE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE,13.63
161-121897-0023,THOU WILT STRAIGHTWAY SEE THE TRUE HAPPINESS I PROMISED,4.63
161-121897-0024,TIS PLAIN TO THE BLIND SAID I THOU DIDST POINT IT OUT EVEN NOW IN SEEKING TO UNFOLD THE CAUSES OF THE FALSE,8.115
161-121897-0025,THAT IS TRUE AND PERFECT HAPPINESS WHICH CROWNS ONE WITH THE UNION OF INDEPENDENCE POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND JOY AND TO PROVE TO THEE WITH HOW DEEP AN INSIGHT I HAVE LISTENED SINCE ALL THESE ARE THE SAME,15.85
161-121897-0026,THAT WHICH CAN TRULY BESTOW ONE OF THEM I KNOW TO BE WITHOUT DOUBT FULL AND COMPLETE HAPPINESS HAPPY ART THOU MY SCHOLAR IN THIS THY CONVICTION ONLY ONE THING SHOULDST THOU ADD,16.06
161-121897-0027,WHAT IS THAT SAID I IS THERE AUGHT THINKEST THOU AMID THESE MORTAL AND PERISHABLE THINGS WHICH CAN PRODUCE A STATE SUCH AS THIS NAY SURELY NOT,11.725
161-121897-0028,AND THIS THOU HAST SO AMPLY DEMONSTRATED THAT NO WORD MORE IS NEEDED WELL THEN THESE THINGS SEEM TO GIVE TO MORTALS SHADOWS OF THE TRUE GOOD OR SOME KIND OF IMPERFECT GOOD,14.145
161-121897-0029,BUT THE TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD THEY CANNOT BESTOW EVEN SO SAID I SINCE THEN THOU HAST LEARNT WHAT THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS AND WHAT MEN FALSELY CALL HAPPINESS,15.68
161-121897-0030,IT NOW REMAINS THAT THOU SHOULDST LEARN FROM WHAT SOURCE TO SEEK THIS YES TO THIS I HAVE LONG BEEN EAGERLY LOOKING FORWARD WELL SINCE AS PLATO MAINTAINS IN THE TIMAEUS,16.3999375
161-121897-0031,WE OUGHT EVEN IN THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS TO IMPLORE THE DIVINE PROTECTION WHAT THINKEST THOU SHOULD WE NOW DO IN ORDER TO DESERVE TO FIND THE SEAT OF THAT HIGHEST GOOD,13.6000625
161-121897-0032,WE MUST INVOKE THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS SAID I FOR WITHOUT THIS NO ENTERPRISE SETS OUT FROM A RIGHT BEGINNING,9.12
161-121897-0033,AND FORTHWITH LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND SANG,4.345
161-121897-0034,TO ALL THAT MOVES THE SOURCE OF MOVEMENT FIXED THYSELF AND MOVELESS THEE NO CAUSE IMPELLED EXTRINSIC THIS PROPORTIONED FRAME TO SHAPE FROM SHAPELESS MATTER,13.755
161-121897-0035,BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED,15.925
161-121897-0036,BEING THYSELF MOST BEAUTIFUL SO THOU THE WORK DIDST FASHION IN THAT FAIR LIKENESS BIDDING IT PUT ON PERFECTION THROUGH THE EXQUISITE PERFECTNESS OF EVERY PART'S CONTRIVANCE,14.21
161-121897-0037,OR WEIGHT OF WATERS WHELM THE EARTH THOU JOINEST AND DIFFUSEST THROUGH THE WHOLE LINKING ACCORDANTLY ITS SEVERAL PARTS A SOUL OF THREEFOLD NATURE MOVING ALL,15.24
161-121897-0038,THIS CLEFT IN TWAIN AND IN TWO CIRCLES GATHERED SPEEDS IN A PATH THAT ON ITSELF RETURNS ENCOMPASSING MIND'S LIMITS AND CONFORMS THE HEAVENS TO HER TRUE SEMBLANCE,13.72
161-121897-0039,EACH TO ITS STARRY CAR AFFIXING,3.19
161-121897-0040,THESE BY A LAW BENIGN THOU BIDDEST TURN AGAIN,3.775
161-121897-0041,AND SHINE IN THINE OWN SPLENDOUR,2.58
161-121898-0000,SINCE NOW THOU HAST SEEN WHAT IS THE FORM OF THE IMPERFECT GOOD AND WHAT THE FORM OF THE PERFECT ALSO,8.04
161-121898-0001,METHINKS I SHOULD NEXT SHOW IN WHAT MANNER THIS PERFECTION OF FELICITY IS BUILT UP AND HERE I CONCEIVE IT PROPER TO INQUIRE FIRST WHETHER ANY EXCELLENCE SUCH AS THOU HAST LATELY DEFINED,13.83
161-121898-0002,CAN EXIST IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEST WE BE DECEIVED BY AN EMPTY FICTION OF THOUGHT TO WHICH NO TRUE REALITY ANSWERS,9.17
161-121898-0003,THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS GOOD FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS CALLED IMPERFECT IS SPOKEN OF AS IMPERFECT BY REASON OF THE PRIVATION OF SOME PERFECTION,11.705
161-121898-0004,SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT WHENEVER IMPERFECTION IS FOUND IN ANY PARTICULAR THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE A PERFECTION IN RESPECT OF THAT PARTICULAR ALSO FOR WERE THERE NO SUCH PERFECTION,14.935
161-121898-0005,IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT,12.935
161-121898-0006,SHE STARTS WITH WHAT IS WHOLE AND PERFECT AND FALLS AWAY LATER TO THESE FEEBLE AND INFERIOR PRODUCTIONS SO IF THERE IS AS WE SHOWED BEFORE A HAPPINESS OF A FRAIL AND IMPERFECT KIND,16.24
161-121898-0007,IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED BUT THERE IS ALSO A HAPPINESS SUBSTANTIAL AND PERFECT MOST TRUE IS THY CONCLUSION AND MOST SURE SAID I NEXT,14.615
161-121898-0008,TO CONSIDER WHERE THE DWELLING PLACE OF THIS HAPPINESS MAY BE THE COMMON BELIEF OF ALL MANKIND AGREES THAT GOD THE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS IS GOOD FOR SINCE NOTHING CAN BE IMAGINED BETTER THAN GOD,15.68
161-121898-0009,HOW CAN WE DOUBT HIM TO BE GOOD THAN WHOM THERE IS NOTHING BETTER NOW REASON SHOWS GOD TO BE GOOD IN SUCH WISE AS TO PROVE THAT IN HIM IS PERFECT GOOD FOR WERE IT NOT SO,14.86
161-121898-0010,HE WOULD NOT BE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS FOR THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE MORE EXCELLENT POSSESSED OF PERFECT GOOD WHICH WOULD SEEM TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IN PRIORITY AND DIGNITY,11.565
161-121898-0011,BUT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS THE PERFECT GOOD THEREFORE TRUE HAPPINESS MUST DWELL IN THE SUPREME DEITY I ACCEPT THY REASONINGS SAID I,13.445
161-121898-0012,THEY CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DISPUTED BUT COME SEE HOW STRICTLY AND INCONTROVERTIBLY THOU MAYST PROVE THIS OUR ASSERTION,11.685
161-121898-0013,OF THE HIGHEST GOOD IN WHAT WAY PRAY SAID I DO NOT RASHLY SUPPOSE THAT HE WHO IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS HATH RECEIVED THAT HIGHEST GOOD OF WHICH HE IS SAID TO BE POSSESSED EITHER FROM SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE,15.625
161-121898-0014,OR HATH IT AS A NATURAL ENDOWMENT IN SUCH SORT THAT THOU MIGHTEST CONSIDER THE ESSENCE OF THE HAPPINESS POSSESSED,8.385
161-121898-0015,DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FOR IF THOU DEEMEST IT RECEIVED FROM WITHOUT THOU MAYST ESTEEM THAT WHICH GIVES MORE EXCELLENT THAN THAT WHICH HAS RECEIVED,11.725
161-121898-0016,BUT HIM WE MOST WORTHILY ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE THE MOST SUPREMELY EXCELLENT OF ALL THINGS IF HOWEVER IT IS IN HIM BY NATURE YET IS LOGICALLY DISTINCT THE THOUGHT IS INCONCEIVABLE,14.265
161-121898-0017,SINCE WE ARE SPEAKING OF GOD WHO IS SUPREME OF ALL THINGS WHO WAS THERE TO JOIN THESE DISTINCT ESSENCES FINALLY WHEN ONE THING IS DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER THE THINGS SO CONCEIVED AS DISTINCT,15.91
161-121898-0018,CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT,14.895
161-121898-0019,FOR UNIVERSALLY NOTHING CAN BE BETTER IN NATURE THAN THE SOURCE FROM WHICH IT HAS COME THEREFORE ON MOST TRUE GROUNDS OF REASON WOULD I CONCLUDE THAT WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS TO BE,13.74
161-121898-0020,IN ITS OWN ESSENCE THE HIGHEST GOOD AND MOST JUSTLY SAID I BUT THE HIGHEST GOOD HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO BE HAPPINESS YES THEN SAID SHE,14.59
161-121898-0021,IT IS NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GOD IS VERY HAPPINESS YES SAID I I CANNOT GAINSAY MY FORMER ADMISSIONS AND I SEE CLEARLY THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY INFERENCE THEREFROM,14.37
161-121898-0022,REFLECT ALSO SAID SHE WHETHER THE SAME CONCLUSION IS NOT FURTHER CONFIRMED BY CONSIDERING THAT THERE CANNOT BE TWO SUPREME GOODS DISTINCT ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THE GOODS WHICH ARE DIFFERENT,14.915
161-121898-0023,CLEARLY CANNOT BE SEVERALLY EACH WHAT THE OTHER IS WHEREFORE NEITHER OF THE TWO CAN BE PERFECT SINCE TO EITHER THE OTHER IS WANTING,9.89
161-121898-0024,BY NO MEANS THEN CAN GOODS WHICH ARE SUPREME BE DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH HAPPINESS AND GOD ARE THE SUPREME GOOD WHEREFORE THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST DIVINITY,13.26
161-121898-0025,TO WHICH THEY GIVE THE NAME DEDUCTIONS SO WILL I ADD HERE A SORT OF COROLLARY FOR SINCE MEN BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF HAPPINESS WHILE HAPPINESS IS VERY GODSHIP,13.885
161-121898-0026,IT IS MANIFEST THAT THEY BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF GODSHIP BUT AS BY THE ACQUISITION OF JUSTICE MEN BECOME JUST AND WISE BY THE ACQUISITION OF WISDOM,14.06
161-121898-0027,SO BY PARITY OF REASONING BY ACQUIRING GODSHIP THEY MUST OF NECESSITY BECOME GODS SO EVERY MAN WHO IS HAPPY IS A GOD AND THOUGH IN NATURE GOD IS ONE ONLY YET THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THAT VERY MANY,16.015
161-121898-0028,SHOULD BE GODS BY PARTICIPATION IN THAT NATURE A FAIR CONCLUSION AND A PRECIOUS SAID I DEDUCTION OR COROLLARY BY WHICHEVER NAME THOU WILT CALL IT AND YET SAID SHE,15.69
161-121898-0029,WHY SEEING HAPPINESS HAS MANY PARTICULARS INCLUDED UNDER IT SHOULD ALL THESE BE REGARDED AS FORMING ONE BODY OF HAPPINESS AS IT WERE MADE UP OF VARIOUS PARTS,13.12
161-121898-0030,OR IS THERE SOME ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMS THE FULL ESSENCE OF HAPPINESS WHILE ALL THE REST ARE RELATIVE TO THIS I WOULD THOU WOULDST UNFOLD THE WHOLE MATTER TO ME AT LARGE,13.675
161-121898-0031,WE JUDGE HAPPINESS TO BE GOOD DO WE NOT YEA THE SUPREME GOOD AND THIS SUPERLATIVE APPLIES TO ALL FOR THIS SAME HAPPINESS IS ADJUDGED TO BE THE COMPLETEST INDEPENDENCE,14.96
161-121898-0032,THE HIGHEST POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND PLEASURE WHAT THEN ARE ALL THESE GOODS INDEPENDENCE POWER AND THE REST TO BE DEEMED MEMBERS OF HAPPINESS AS IT WERE,13.385
161-121898-0033,OR ARE THEY ALL RELATIVE TO GOOD AS TO THEIR SUMMIT AND CROWN I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BUT I DESIRE TO HEAR HOW THOU WOULDST SOLVE IT WELL THEN LISTEN TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE MATTER,16.055
161-121898-0034,WERE ALL THESE MEMBERS COMPOSING HAPPINESS THEY WOULD DIFFER SEVERALLY ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THIS IS THE NATURE OF PARTS,9.29
161-121898-0035,ALL THESE HOWEVER HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE THE SAME THEREFORE THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MEMBERS OTHERWISE HAPPINESS WILL SEEM TO BE BUILT UP OUT OF ONE MEMBER WHICH CANNOT BE,12.48
161-121898-0036,THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT SAID I BUT I AM IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT REMAINS WHY IT IS MANIFEST THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE GOOD,12.115
161-121898-0037,FOR THE VERY REASON WHY INDEPENDENCE IS SOUGHT IS THAT IT IS JUDGED GOOD AND SO POWER ALSO BECAUSE IT IS BELIEVED TO BE GOOD THE SAME TOO MAY BE SUPPOSED OF REVERENCE OF RENOWN AND OF PLEASANT DELIGHT,15.235
161-121898-0038,GOOD THEN IS THE SUM AND SOURCE OF ALL DESIRABLE THINGS THAT WHICH HAS NOT IN ITSELF ANY GOOD EITHER IN REALITY OR IN SEMBLANCE CAN IN NO WISE BE DESIRED CONTRARIWISE,13.84
161-121898-0039,EVEN THINGS WHICH BY NATURE ARE NOT GOOD ARE DESIRED AS IF THEY WERE TRULY GOOD IF THEY SEEM TO BE SO,7.27
161-121898-0040,NOW THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ANYTHING IS DESIRED ITSELF SEEMS TO BE MOST WISHED FOR FOR INSTANCE IF ANYONE WISHES TO RIDE FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH HE DOES NOT SO MUCH WISH FOR THE EXERCISE OF RIDING,14.52
161-121898-0041,AS THE BENEFIT OF HIS HEALTH SINCE THEN ALL THINGS ARE SOUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD IT IS NOT THESE SO MUCH AS GOOD ITSELF THAT IS SOUGHT BY ALL,10.66
161-121898-0042,WAS WE AGREED HAPPINESS WHEREFORE THUS ALSO IT APPEARS THAT IT IS HAPPINESS ALONE WHICH IS SOUGHT FROM ALL WHICH IT IS TRANSPARENTLY CLEAR THAT THE ESSENCE OF ABSOLUTE GOOD AND OF HAPPINESS,14.475
161-121898-0043,IS ONE AND THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE CAN DISSENT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS,7.94
161-121898-0044,THAT GOD AND TRUE HAPPINESS ARE ONE AND THE SAME YES SAID I THEN WE CAN SAFELY CONCLUDE ALSO THAT GOD'S ESSENCE IS SEATED IN ABSOLUTE GOOD AND NOWHERE ELSE,14.335
161-121898-0045,HITHER COME ALL YE WHOSE MINDS LUST WITH ROSY FETTERS BINDS LUST TO BONDAGE HARD COMPELLING,8.5
161-121898-0046,HERE SHALL BE YOUR LABOUR'S CLOSE HERE YOUR HAVEN OF REPOSE COME TO YOUR ONE REFUGE PRESS WIDE IT STANDS TO ALL DISTRESS,11.89
161-121898-0047,NOT THE TAGUS PRECIOUS SANDS,2.83
161-121898-0048,EMERALD GREEN AND GLISTERING WHITE,3.08
161-121898-0049,BUT THEY RATHER LEAVE THE MIND IN ITS NATIVE DARKNESS BLIND FOR THE FAIREST BEAMS THEY SHED IN EARTH'S LOWEST DEPTHS WERE FED BUT THE SPLENDOUR THAT SUPPLIES STRENGTH AND VIGOUR TO THE SKIES,15.365
161-121898-0050,AND THE UNIVERSE CONTROLS,2.26
167-15255-0000,IT WAS NIGHT TIME AND THEY WERE ALL WORKMEN OF THE BETTER CLASS THEY HAD SURROUNDED ONE OF THEIR NUMBER A PLEASANT FACED MAN OF THIRTY AND WERE GIVING IT TO HIM RATHER HEATEDLY BUT OW ABOUT THIS ERE CHEAP IMMIGRATION ONE OF THEM DEMANDED THE JEWS OF WHITECHAPEL SAY,16.05
167-15255-0001,A CUTTING OUR THROATS RIGHT ALONG YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM WAS THE ANSWER THEY'RE JUST LIKE US AND THEY'VE GOT TO LIVE DON'T BLAME THE MAN WHO OFFERS TO WORK CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB BUT OW ABOUT THE WIFE AN KIDDIES HIS INTERLOCUTOR DEMANDED,15.515
167-15255-0002,THERE YOU ARE CAME THE ANSWER HOW ABOUT THE WIFE AND KIDDIES OF THE MAN WHO WORKS CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB EH HOW ABOUT HIS WIFE AND KIDDIES HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THEM THAN IN YOURS AND HE CAN'T SEE THEM STARVE SO HE CUTS THE PRICE OF LABOUR AND OUT YOU GO,15.99
167-15255-0003,BUT YOU MUSTN'T BLAME HIM POOR DEVIL HE CAN'T HELP IT WAGES ALWAYS COME DOWN WHEN TWO MEN ARE AFTER THE SAME JOB THAT'S THE FAULT OF COMPETITION NOT OF THE MAN WHO CUTS THE PRICE BUT WYGES DON'T COME DOWN WHERE THERE'S A UNION THE OBJECTION WAS MADE,15.375
167-15255-0004,AND THERE YOU ARE AGAIN RIGHT ON THE HEAD THE UNION CHEEKS COMPETITION AMONG THE LABOURERS BUT MAKES IT HARDER WHERE THERE ARE NO UNIONS THERE'S WHERE YOUR CHEAP LABOUR OF WHITECHAPEL COMES IN THEY'RE UNSKILLED AND HAVE NO UNIONS,13.445
167-15255-0005,AND CUT EACH OTHER'S THROATS AND OURS IN THE BARGAIN IF WE DON'T BELONG TO A STRONG UNION WITHOUT GOING FURTHER INTO THE ARGUMENT THIS MAN ON THE MILE END WASTE POINTED THE MORAL THAT WHEN TWO MEN WERE AFTER THE ONE JOB WAGES WERE BOUND TO FALL,15.475
167-15255-0006,HAD HE GONE DEEPER INTO THE MATTER HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT EVEN THE UNION SAY TWENTY THOUSAND STRONG COULD NOT HOLD UP WAGES IF TWENTY THOUSAND IDLE MEN WERE TRYING TO DISPLACE THE UNION MEN THIS IS ADMIRABLY INSTANCED JUST NOW,14.87
167-15255-0007,BY THE RETURN AND DISBANDMENT OF THE SOLDIERS FROM SOUTH AFRICA THEY FIND THEMSELVES BY TENS OF THOUSANDS IN DESPERATE STRAITS IN THE ARMY OF THE UNEMPLOYED,9.815
167-15255-0008,THERE IS A GENERAL DECLINE IN WAGES THROUGHOUT THE LAND WHICH GIVING RISE TO LABOUR DISPUTES AND STRIKES IS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE UNEMPLOYED WHO GLADLY PICK UP THE TOOLS THROWN DOWN BY THE STRIKERS SWEATING,13.31
167-15255-0009,STARVATION WAGES ARMIES OF UNEMPLOYED AND GREAT NUMBERS OF THE HOMELESS AND SHELTERLESS ARE INEVITABLE WHEN THERE ARE MORE MEN TO DO WORK THAN THERE IS WORK FOR MEN TO DO THE MEN AND WOMEN I HAVE MET UPON THE STREETS AND IN THE SPIKES AND PEGS,15.47
167-15255-0010,ARE NOT THERE BECAUSE AS A MODE OF LIFE IT MAY BE CONSIDERED A SOFT SNAP I HAVE SUFFICIENTLY OUTLINED THE HARDSHIPS THEY UNDERGO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR EXISTENCE IS ANYTHING BUT SOFT,12.69
167-15255-0011,IT IS A MATTER OF SOBER CALCULATION HERE IN ENGLAND THAT IT IS SOFTER TO WORK FOR TWENTY SHILLINGS A WEEK AND HAVE REGULAR FOOD AND A BED AT NIGHT THAN IT IS TO WALK THE STREETS THE MAN WHO WALKS THE STREETS SUFFERS MORE AND WORKS HARDER,15.28
167-15255-0012,FOR FAR LESS RETURN I HAVE DEPICTED THE NIGHTS THEY SPEND AND HOW DRIVEN IN BY PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION THEY GO TO THE CASUAL WARD FOR A REST UP NOR IS THE CASUAL WARD A SOFT SNAP,12.295
167-15255-0013,TO PICK FOUR POUNDS OF OAKUM BREAK TWELVE HUNDREDWEIGHT OF STONES OR PERFORM THE MOST REVOLTING TASKS IN RETURN FOR THE MISERABLE FOOD AND SHELTER THEY RECEIVE IS AN UNQUALIFIED EXTRAVAGANCE ON THE PART OF THE MEN WHO ARE GUILTY OF IT,15.175
167-15255-0014,THEY GIVE THE MEN FAR LESS FOR THEIR LABOUR THAN DO THE CAPITALISTIC EMPLOYERS THE WAGE FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF LABOUR PERFORMED FOR A PRIVATE EMPLOYER WOULD BUY THEM BETTER BEDS BETTER FOOD MORE GOOD CHEER AND ABOVE ALL GREATER FREEDOM,15.035
167-15255-0015,AS I SAY IT IS AN EXTRAVAGANCE FOR A MAN TO PATRONISE A CASUAL WARD AND THAT THEY KNOW IT THEMSELVES IS SHOWN BY THE WAY THESE MEN SHUN IT TILL DRIVEN IN BY PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION THEN WHY DO THEY DO IT,13.57
167-15255-0016,NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED WORKERS THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS IN THE UNITED STATES THE TRAMP IS ALMOST INVARIABLY A DISCOURAGED WORKER HE FINDS TRAMPING A SOFTER MODE OF LIFE THAN WORKING,14.45
167-15255-0017,BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE IN ENGLAND HERE THE POWERS THAT BE DO THEIR UTMOST TO DISCOURAGE THE TRAMP AND VAGABOND AND HE IS IN ALL TRUTH A MIGHTILY DISCOURAGED CREATURE HE KNOWS THAT TWO SHILLINGS A DAY WHICH IS ONLY FIFTY CENTS,15.545
167-15255-0018,WILL BUY HIM THREE FAIR MEALS A BED AT NIGHT AND LEAVE HIM A COUPLE OF PENNIES FOR POCKET MONEY HE WOULD RATHER WORK FOR THOSE TWO SHILLINGS THAN FOR THE CHARITY OF THE CASUAL WARD FOR HE KNOWS THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORK SO HARD AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SO ABOMINABLY TREATED,15.795
167-15255-0019,HE DOES NOT DO SO HOWEVER BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE MEN TO DO WORK THAN THERE IS WORK FOR MEN TO DO WHEN THERE ARE MORE MEN THAN THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE A SIFTING OUT PROCESS MUST OBTAIN IN EVERY BRANCH OF INDUSTRY THE LESS EFFICIENT ARE CROWDED OUT,15.36
167-15255-0020,BEING CROWDED OUT BECAUSE OF INEFFICIENCY THEY CANNOT GO UP BUT MUST DESCEND AND CONTINUE TO DESCEND UNTIL THEY REACH THEIR PROPER LEVEL A PLACE IN THE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC WHERE THEY ARE EFFICIENT IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE AND IT IS INEXORABLE,15.775
167-15255-0021,THAT THE LEAST EFFICIENT MUST DESCEND TO THE VERY BOTTOM WHICH IS THE SHAMBLES WHEREIN THEY PERISH MISERABLY A GLANCE AT THE CONFIRMED INEFFICIENTS AT THE BOTTOM,12.095
167-15255-0022,AND UPON WHOM THE WRECKING PROCESS IS JUST BEGINNING TO OPERATE ALL THE FORCES HERE IT MUST BE REMEMBERED ARE DESTRUCTIVE THE GOOD BODY WHICH IS THERE BECAUSE ITS BRAIN IS NOT QUICK AND CAPABLE IS SPEEDILY WRENCHED AND TWISTED OUT OF SHAPE,15.935
167-15255-0023,THE CLEAN MIND WHICH IS THERE BECAUSE OF ITS WEAK BODY IS SPEEDILY FOULED AND CONTAMINATED THE MORTALITY IS EXCESSIVE BUT EVEN THEN THEY DIE FAR TOO LINGERING DEATHS,13.725
167-15255-0024,HERE THEN WE HAVE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ABYSS AND THE SHAMBLES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC A CONSTANT ELIMINATION IS GOING ON THE INEFFICIENT ARE WEEDED OUT AND FLUNG DOWNWARD VARIOUS THINGS CONSTITUTE INEFFICIENCY,14.095
167-15255-0025,THE ENGINEER WHO IS IRREGULAR OR IRRESPONSIBLE WILL SINK DOWN UNTIL HE FINDS HIS PLACE SAY AS A CASUAL LABOURER AN OCCUPATION IRREGULAR IN ITS VERY NATURE AND IN WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RESPONSIBILITY,14.0
167-15255-0026,THOSE WHO ARE SLOW AND CLUMSY WHO SUFFER FROM WEAKNESS OF BODY OR MIND OR WHO LACK NERVOUS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STAMINA MUST SINK DOWN SOMETIMES RAPIDLY SOMETIMES STEP BY STEP TO THE BOTTOM,13.265
167-15255-0027,ACCIDENT BY DISABLING AN EFFICIENT WORKER WILL MAKE HIM INEFFICIENT AND DOWN HE MUST GO AND THE WORKER WHO BECOMES AGED WITH FAILING ENERGY AND NUMBING BRAIN MUST BEGIN THE FRIGHTFUL DESCENT,13.225
167-15255-0028,WHICH KNOWS NO STOPPING PLACE SHORT OF THE BOTTOM AND DEATH IN THIS LAST INSTANCE THE STATISTICS OF LONDON TELL A TERRIBLE TALE THE POPULATION OF LONDON IS ONE SEVENTH OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM,14.62
167-15255-0029,AND IN LONDON YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT ONE ADULT IN EVERY FOUR DIES ON PUBLIC CHARITY EITHER IN THE WORKHOUSE THE HOSPITAL OR THE ASYLUM,10.585
167-15255-0030,WHEN THE FACT THAT THE WELL TO DO DO NOT END THUS IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IT BECOMES MANIFEST THAT IT IS THE FATE OF AT LEAST ONE IN EVERY THREE ADULT WORKERS TO DIE ON PUBLIC CHARITY,14.425
167-15255-0031,AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW A GOOD WORKER MAY SUDDENLY BECOME INEFFICIENT AND WHAT THEN HAPPENS TO HIM I AM TEMPTED TO GIVE THE CASE OF M'GARRY A MAN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF AGE AND AN INMATE OF THE WORKHOUSE,12.115
167-15255-0032,THE EXTRACTS ARE QUOTED FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TRADE UNION I WORKED AT SULLIVAN'S PLACE IN WIDNES BETTER KNOWN AS THE BRITISH ALKALI CHEMICAL WORKS I WAS WORKING IN A SHED AND I HAD TO CROSS THE YARD IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT ABOUT,15.33
167-15255-0033,WHILE CROSSING THE YARD I FELT SOMETHING TAKE HOLD OF MY LEG AND SCREW IT OFF I BECAME UNCONSCIOUS,5.665
167-15255-0034,ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY NIGHT I CAME TO MY SENSES AND FOUND MYSELF IN THE HOSPITAL I ASKED THE NURSE WHAT WAS TO DO WITH MY LEGS AND SHE TOLD ME BOTH LEGS WERE OFF THERE WAS A STATIONARY CRANK IN THE YARD LET INTO THE GROUND,13.2199375
167-15255-0035,THE HOLE WAS EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG FIFTEEN INCHES DEEP AND FIFTEEN INCHES WIDE THE CRANK REVOLVED IN THE HOLE THREE REVOLUTIONS A MINUTE THERE WAS NO FENCE OR COVERING OVER THE HOLE SINCE MY ACCIDENT,11.4650625
167-15255-0036,AND HAVE COVERED THE HOLE UP WITH A PIECE OF SHEET IRON THEY GAVE ME TWENTY FIVE POUNDS THEY DIDN'T RECKON THAT AS COMPENSATION THEY SAID IT WAS ONLY FOR CHARITY'S SAKE OUT OF THAT I PAID NINE POUNDS FOR A MACHINE BY WHICH TO WHEEL MYSELF ABOUT,14.395
167-15255-0037,I WAS LABOURING AT THE TIME I GOT MY LEGS OFF I GOT TWENTY FOUR SHILLINGS A WEEK RATHER BETTER PAY THAN THE OTHER MEN BECAUSE I USED TO TAKE SHIFTS WHEN THERE WAS HEAVY WORK TO BE DONE I USED TO BE PICKED OUT TO DO IT MISTER MANTON THE MANAGER VISITED ME AT THE HOSPITAL SEVERAL TIMES,15.545
167-15255-0038,WHEN I WAS GETTING BETTER I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND ME A JOB HE TOLD ME NOT TO TROUBLE MYSELF AS THE FIRM WAS NOT COLD HEARTED I WOULD BE RIGHT ENOUGH IN ANY CASE MISTER MANTON STOPPED COMING TO SEE ME,11.8
167-15255-0039,AND THE LAST TIME HE SAID HE THOUGHT OF ASKING THE DIRECTORS TO GIVE ME A FIFTY POUND NOTE SO I COULD GO HOME TO MY FRIENDS IN IRELAND POOR M'GARRY HE RECEIVED RATHER BETTER PAY THAN THE OTHER MEN BECAUSE HE WAS AMBITIOUS AND TOOK SHIFTS,14.31
167-15255-0040,AND WHEN HEAVY WORK WAS TO BE DONE HE WAS THE MAN PICKED OUT TO DO IT AND THEN THE THING HAPPENED AND HE WENT INTO THE WORKHOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO THE WORKHOUSE IS TO GO HOME TO IRELAND AND BURDEN HIS FRIENDS FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,14.025
167-15255-0041,COMMENT IS SUPERFLUOUS IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT EFFICIENCY IS NOT DETERMINED BY THE WORKERS THEMSELVES BUT IS DETERMINED BY THE DEMAND FOR LABOUR IF THREE MEN SEEK ONE POSITION THE MOST EFFICIENT MAN WILL GET IT,14.105
167-15255-0042,THE OTHER TWO NO MATTER HOW CAPABLE THEY MAY BE WILL NONE THE LESS BE INEFFICIENTS IF GERMANY JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CAPTURE THE ENTIRE WORLD MARKET FOR IRON COAL AND TEXTILES,13.385
167-15255-0043,AT ONCE THE ENGLISH WORKERS WOULD BE THROWN IDLE BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SOME WOULD EMIGRATE BUT THE REST WOULD RUSH THEIR LABOUR INTO THE REMAINING INDUSTRIES A GENERAL SHAKING UP OF THE WORKERS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WOULD RESULT AND WHEN EQUILIBRIUM HAD BEEN RESTORED,15.38
167-15255-0044,THE NUMBER OF THE INEFFICIENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ON THE OTHER HAND CONDITIONS REMAINING CONSTANT AND ALL THE WORKERS DOUBLING THEIR EFFICIENCY THERE WOULD STILL BE AS MANY INEFFICIENTS,15.735
167-15255-0045,THOUGH EACH INEFFICIENT WERE TWICE AS CAPABLE AS HE HAD BEEN AND MORE CAPABLE THAN MANY OF THE EFFICIENTS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN WHEN THERE ARE MORE MEN TO WORK THAN THERE IS WORK FOR MEN TO DO JUST AS MANY MEN AS ARE IN EXCESS OF WORK,15.865
167-15255-0046,WILL BE INEFFICIENTS AND AS INEFFICIENTS THEY ARE DOOMED TO LINGERING AND PAINFUL DESTRUCTION,6.175
167-68704-0000,PROBABLY THE CHIEF BARRIER TO THE COMMISSION OF CRIME IS THE FEELING OF RIGHT AND WRONG CONNECTED WITH THE DOING OR NOT DOING OF PARTICULAR ACTS ALL MEN HAVE A MORE OR LESS BINDING CONSCIENCE THIS IS THE RESULT OF LONG TEACHING,15.3
167-68704-0001,AND HABIT IN MATTERS OF CONDUCT MOST PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT AT HOME AND IN SCHOOL THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE RIGHT AND THAT OTHERS ARE WRONG THIS CONSTANT INSTRUCTION BUILDS UP HABITS AND RULES OF CONDUCT,13.105
167-68704-0002,AND IT IS MAINLY UPON THESE THAT SOCIETY DEPENDS FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF ITS CITIZENS TO MOST MEN CONSCIENCE IS THE MONITOR RATHER THAN LAW IT ACTS MORE AUTOMATICALLY,12.42
167-68704-0003,AND A SHOCK TO THE CONSCIENCE IS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT A LAW IS BROKEN FOR THE MOST PART THE PROMPTINGS OF CONSCIENCE FOLLOW PRETTY CLOSELY THE INHIBITIONS OF THE CRIMINAL CODE ALTHOUGH THEY MAY OR MAY NOT FOLLOW THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW,15.165
167-68704-0004,EACH PERSON HAS HIS OWN IDEA OF THE RELATIVE VALUES ATTACHED TO HUMAN ACTIONS,5.365
167-68704-0005,NO TWO ETHICAL COMMANDS HAVE THE SAME IMPORTANCE TO ALL PEOPLE OR TO ANY TWO PEOPLE OFTEN MEN DO NOT HESITATE TO CIRCUMVENT OR VIOLATE ONE STATUTE,11.74
167-68704-0006,TO VIOLATE ANOTHER ORDINARILY UNLESS THE RESPONSE OF CONSCIENCE IS QUICK AND PLAIN MEN ARE NOT BOTHERED BY THE INFRACTION OF THE LAW EXCEPT PERCHANCE BY THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY,12.945
167-68704-0007,THIS IS QUITE APART FROM THE TEACHING THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF ALL MEN TO OBEY ALL LAWS A PROPOSITION SO GENERAL THAT IT HAS NO EFFECT EVEN THOSE WHO MAKE THE STATEMENT DO NOT FOLLOW THE PRECEPT,13.745
167-68704-0008,AND THE LONG LIST OF PENAL LAWS THAT DIE FROM LACK OF ENFORCEMENT INSTEAD OF BY REPEAL IS TOO WELL KNOWN TO WARRANT THE BELIEF THAT ANYONE PAYS SERIOUS ATTENTION TO SUCH A PURELY ACADEMIC STATEMENT NO ONE,16.29
167-68704-0009,BELIEVES IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF ALL LAWS OR THE DUTY TO OBEY ALL LAWS AND NO ONE IN FACT DOES OBEY THEM ALL THOSE WHO PROCLAIM THE LOUDEST THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE TO ALL LAWS NEVER OBEY,15.915
167-68704-0010,FOR EXAMPLE THE REVENUE LAWS THESE ARE CLEAR AND EXPLICIT AND YET MEN TAKE EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THEIR PROPERTY EXEMPTED FROM TAXATION IN OTHER WORDS TO DEFRAUD THE STATE,14.355
167-68704-0011,THIS IS DONE ON THE EXCUSE THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES IT AND THE MAN WHO MAKES A STRICT RETURN ACCORDING TO LAW WOULD PAY THE TAXES OF THE SHIRKERS WHILE THIS IS TRUE IT SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ALL MEN VIOLATE THE LAW,13.725
167-68704-0012,WHEN THE JUSTIFICATION SEEMS SUFFICIENT TO THEM THE LAWS AGAINST BLASPHEMY AGAINST SUNDAY WORK AND SUNDAY PLAY AGAINST BUYING AND TRANSPORTING INTOXICATING LIQUORS AND SMUGGLING GOODS,14.58
167-68704-0013,ARE FREELY VIOLATED MANY LAWS ARE SO RECENT THAT THEY HAVE NOT GROWN TO BE FOLK WAYS OR FIXED NEW HABITS AND THEIR VIOLATION BRINGS NO MORAL SHOCK IN SPITE OF THE PROFESSIONS OFTEN MADE,14.405
167-68704-0014,MOST MEN HAVE A POOR OPINION OF CONGRESSMEN AND LEGISLATORS AND FEEL THAT THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE IS A MUCH HIGHER GUIDE FOR THEM THAN THE LAW RELIGIONS HAVE ALWAYS TAUGHT OBEDIENCE TO GOD OR TO WHAT TAKES HIS PLACE,15.72
167-68704-0015,RELIGIOUS COMMANDS AND FEELINGS ARE HIGHER AND MORE BINDING ON MAN THAN HUMAN LAW THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY ARE FOREVER BELITTLING AND CRITICISING ALL THOSE LAWS MADE BY LEGISLATURES AND COURTS,13.985
167-68704-0016,WHICH INTERFERE WITH THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF PROPERTY NONE OF THIS SORT OF LEGISLATION HAS THEIR APPROVAL AND THE COURTS ARE REGARDED AS MEDDLESOME WHEN THEY ENFORCE IT THE ANTI TRUST LAWS THE ANTI POOLING LAWS,14.855
167-68704-0017,FACTORY LEGISLATION OF ALL KINDS ANYTHING IN SHORT THAT INTERFERES WITH THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF PROPERTY BY ITS OWNER ARE ROUNDLY CONDEMNED AND VIOLATED BY EVASION ON THE OTHER HAND,13.73
167-68704-0018,SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND SAID IN REFERENCE TO THE CREATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO OWN PROPERTY AND THESE RIGHTS DEPEND SO ABSOLUTELY UPON SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AND WORK OUT SUCH MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY,14.92
167-68704-0019,THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A DEEP SEATED FEELING OF PROTEST AGAINST MANY OF OUR SO CALLED PROPERTY LAWS FROM THOSE WHO ADVOCATE A NEW DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND CONDEMN THE INJUSTICE OF PRESENT PROPERTY RIGHTS THE STEP,14.675
167-68704-0020,IS QUITE SHORT TO THOSE WHO FEEL THE INJUSTICE AND PUT THEIR IDEAS IN FORCE BY TAKING PROPERTY WHEN AND WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO GET IT FOR INSTANCE,12.86
167-68704-0021,A MINER MAY BELIEVE THAT THE CORPORATION FOR WHICH HE WORKS REALLY HAS NO RIGHT TO THE GOLD DOWN IN THE MINE AS HE IS DIGGING HE STRIKES A PARTICULARLY RICH POCKET OF HIGH GRADE ORE,12.9
167-68704-0022,HE FEELS THAT HE DOES NO WRONG IF HE APPROPRIATES THE ORE ELABORATE MEANS ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT THIS EVEN COMPELLING THE ABSOLUTE STRIPPING OF THE WORKMAN AND A COMPLETE CHANGE OF CLOTHES ON GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THE MINE,15.305
167-68704-0023,MANY LAWS ARE PUT ON THE BOOKS WHICH ARE OF A PURELY SUMPTUARY NATURE THESE ATTEMPT TO CONTROL WHAT ONE SHALL DO IN HIS OWN PERSONAL AFFAIRS SUCH LAWS ARE BROUGHT ABOUT BY ORGANIZATIONS WITH A PURPOSE,14.385
167-68704-0024,THE MEMBERS ARE ANXIOUS TO MAKE EVERYONE ELSE CONFORM TO THEIR IDEAS AND HABITS SUCH LAWS AS SUNDAY LAWS LIQUOR LAWS AND THE LIKE ARE EXAMPLES,11.545
167-68704-0025,THEN TOO EVERY STATE OR NATION CARRIES A LARGE LIST OF LAWS THAT MEN HAVE SO LONG VIOLATED AND IGNORED THAT THEY VIRTUALLY ARE DEAD TO VIOLATE THESE BRINGS NO FEELING OF WRONG,13.025
167-68704-0026,BUT ONLY SERVES TO MAKE MEN DOUBT THE EVIL OF VIOLATING ANY LAW IT IS NEVER EASY TO GET A LEGISLATURE TO REPEAL A LAW GENERALLY SOME ORGANIZATION OR COMMITTEE OF PEOPLE,14.63
167-68704-0027,IS INTERESTED IN KEEPING IT ALIVE AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FEAR LOSING THEIR VOTES SOCIAL IDEAS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING NO LAWS OR CUSTOMS ARE ETERNAL THE ORDINARY MAN AND ESPECIALLY THE MAN UNDER THE NORMAL,16.545
167-68704-0028,CANNOT KEEP UP WITH ALL THE SHIFTING OF A CHANGING WORLD THERE IS ALWAYS A FRACTION OF A COMMUNITY AGITATING FOR SOMETHING NEW AND GRADUALLY FORCING THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT IT INTO LAW EVEN AGAINST THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY,14.85
167-68704-0029,AND AGAINST THE SENTIMENT OF A LARGE CLASS OF THE COMMUNITY THE ORGANIZATION THAT WANTS SOMETHING DONE IS ALWAYS AGGRESSIVE THE MAN WHO WANTS TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING DONE IS SELDOM UNDULY ACTIVE OR EVEN ALARMED,15.65
167-68704-0030,MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE EAGER TO GET STATUTES ON THE BOOKS ONE SELDOM HEARS OF A SOCIETY OR CLUB THAT IS ACTIVE IN GETTING LAWS REPEALED THE CONSTANT CHANGE OF LAW,14.57
167-68704-0031,IS NECESSARY TO SOCIAL LIFE THIS MEANS PUTTING NEW WINE INTO OLD BOTTLES AND WINE THAT IS MUCH TOO STRONG FOR THE BOTTLES EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHY SOME PARTICULAR LAW MIGHT BE VIOLATED,14.475
167-68704-0032,WITHOUT A SENSE OF GUILT BUT THEY CANNOT SEE HOW A LAW THEY BELIEVE IN CAN BE VIOLATED WITHOUT SERIOUS OBLIQUITY APART FROM THIS THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CRIMES THAT WERE NOT OF THE CLASS THAT IMPLIED MORAL WRONG,16.17
167-68704-0033,THE ACTS OF THE REVOLUTIONIST WHO SAW OR THOUGHT HE SAW VISIONS OF SOMETHING BETTER THE MAN WHO IS INSPIRED BY THE LOVE OF HIS FELLOW MAN AND WHO HAS NO PERSONAL ENDS TO GAIN,12.655
167-68704-0034,THE MAN WHO IN HIS DEVOTION TO AN IDEA OR A PERSON RISKS HIS LIFE OR LIBERTY OR PROPERTY OR REPUTATION HAS NEVER BEEN CLASSED WITH THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE LAW FOR SELFISH ENDS THE LINE OF REVOLUTIONISTS,14.9749375
167-68704-0035,FROM THE BEGINNING OF ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT DOWN TO THE BIRTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND EVEN TO THE PRESENT TIME FURNISHES AMPLE PROOF OF THIS AND STILL THE UNSUCCESSFUL REVOLUTIONIST MEETS WITH THE SEVEREST PENALTIES TO HIM,16.1900625
167-68704-0036,FAILURE GENERALLY MEANS DEATH MEN WHO ARE FIRED WITH ZEAL FOR ALL NEW CAUSES ARE FOREVER RUNNING FOUL OF THE LAW SOCIAL ORGANIZATION LIKE BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION IS CONSERVATIVE ALL THINGS THAT LIVE,16.1
167-68704-0037,ARE IMBUED WITH THE WILL TO LIVE AND THEY TAKE ALL MEANS IN THEIR POWER TO GO ON LIVING THE PHILOSOPHER CAN NEITHER QUARREL WITH THE IDEALIST WHO MAKES THE SACRIFICE NOR THE ORGANIZATION THAT PRESERVES ITSELF WHILE IT CAN,15.08
167-68704-0038,HE ONLY RECOGNIZES WHAT IS TRUE MEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OBLIGED TO FIGHT TO PRESERVE LIBERTY CONSTITUTIONS AND LAWS DO NOT SAFEGUARD LIBERTY,13.47
167-68704-0039,IT CAN BE PRESERVED ONLY BY A TOLERANT PEOPLE AND THIS MEANS ETERNAL CONFLICT EMERSON SAID THAT THE GOOD CITIZEN MUST NOT BE OVER OBEDIENT TO LAW FREEDOM IS ALWAYS TRAMPLED ON,15.305
167-68704-0040,IN TIMES OF STRESS THE UNITED STATES SUFFERED SERIOUS ENCROACHMENTS ON LIBERTY DURING THE CIVIL WAR DURING THE LAST WAR THESE ENCROACHMENTS WERE GREATER THAN ANY AMERICAN COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DREAMED,15.445
167-68704-0041,AND SO FAR THERE SEEMS LITTLE IMMEDIATE CHANCE FOR CHANGE STILL THE PHILOSOPHER DOES NOT COMPLAIN HE SEES HUMAN PASSION FOR WHAT IT IS A GREAT EMOTION THAT HOLDS MEN IN ITS GRASP,15.095
167-68704-0042,A FEELING THAT NOTHING CAN STAND AGAINST OPPOSITION IS DESTROYED BY FORCE AND OFTEN BLIND CRUEL UNREASONING FORCE SOMETIMES EVEN WORSE THIS FORCE IS CREATED FOR SELFISH ENDS,15.79
167-68704-0043,THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO WILL USE THE STRONGEST AND HIGHEST EMOTIONS OF MEN TO SERVE THEIR PRIVATE SORDID ENDS CHANGING SOCIAL SYSTEMS NEW POLITICAL IDEAS THE LABOR CAUSE,14.735
167-68704-0044,ALL MOVEMENTS FOR RELIGIOUS SOCIAL OR POLITICAL CHANGE HAVE THEIR ZEALOTS THEY ARE MET BY THE FORCE OF CONVENTION AND CONSERVATISM READY TO DEFEND ITSELF AND THE CLASH IS INEVITABLE,14.54
167-68704-0045,IT IS EASY TO DISTINGUISH THIS SORT OF ACTION FROM THE THINGS DONE BY THOSE WHO ARE KNOWN AS CRIMINALS THEIR ACTS ARE DONE TO SERVE PERSONAL ENDS,11.01

168-129246-0036,THEN SPLOSH THE KING ROSE UP AND SAID IT'S NOT POLITE BUT HE'S SAFER DEAD AND THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM IN THE LAND OF GOSH FOR A GLUG NAMED JOI AND A KING CALLED SPLOSH AND EVERY GLUG FLUNG HIGH HIS HAT AND CRIED,13.37
168-129246-0037,WE'RE GLUGS AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT SO THEY CLIMBED THE TREES SINCE THE WEATHER WAS COLD WHILE THE BRAZEN BELL OF THE CITY TOLLED AND TOLLED AND TOLD THE FATE OF A GLUG WHO WAS OVER BOLD,13.59

168-129246-0040,AND THE GLUGS WERE TICKLED WITH WHAT THEY'D DONE AND AFTER THAT IF A DAY SHOULD COME WHEN A GLUG FELT EXTRA SPECIALLY GLUM HE'D CALL HIS CHILDREN AROUND HIS KNEE AND TELL THAT TALE WITH A CHUCKLE OF GLEE AND SHOULD A LITTLE GLUG GIRL OR BOY SEE NAUGHT OF A JOKE IN THE FATE OF JOI,16.525

173-200-0000,EVERY MORNING NOW BROUGHT ITS REGULAR DUTIES SHOPS WERE TO BE VISITED SOME NEW PART OF THE TOWN TO BE LOOKED AT AND THE PUMP ROOM TO BE ATTENDED WHERE THEY PARADED UP AND DOWN FOR AN HOUR,14.73
173-200-0001,LOOKING AT EVERYBODY AND SPEAKING TO NO ONE THE WISH OF A NUMEROUS ACQUAINTANCE IN BATH WAS STILL UPPERMOST WITH MISSUS ALLEN,9.515
173-200-0002,AND SHE REPEATED IT AFTER EVERY FRESH PROOF WHICH EVERY MORNING BROUGHT OF HER KNOWING NOBODY AT ALL THEY MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE LOWER ROOMS AND HERE FORTUNE WAS MORE FAVOURABLE TO OUR HEROINE,15.655
173-200-0003,THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES INTRODUCED TO HER A VERY GENTLEMANLIKE YOUNG MAN AS A PARTNER HIS NAME WAS TILNEY HE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY,14.16

173-200-0005,AND CATHERINE FELT HERSELF IN HIGH LUCK THERE WAS LITTLE LEISURE FOR SPEAKING WHILE THEY DANCED BUT WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TEA SHE FOUND HIM AS AGREEABLE AS SHE HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR BEING,14.615
173-200-0006,HE TALKED WITH FLUENCY AND SPIRIT AND THERE WAS AN ARCHNESS AND PLEASANTRY IN HIS MANNER WHICH INTERESTED THOUGH IT WAS HARDLY UNDERSTOOD BY HER,11.89
173-200-0007,AFTER CHATTING SOME TIME ON SUCH MATTERS AS NATURALLY AROSE FROM THE OBJECTS AROUND THEM HE SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HER WITH I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN VERY REMISS MADAM,12.47

173-200-0015,YES I LIKE IT VERY WELL NOW I MUST GIVE ONE SMIRK AND THEN WE MAY BE RATIONAL AGAIN CATHERINE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD NOT KNOWING WHETHER SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO LAUGH,15.14
173-200-0016,I SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME SAID HE GRAVELY I SHALL MAKE BUT A POOR FIGURE IN YOUR JOURNAL TOMORROW MY JOURNAL YES I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL SAY,15.74
173-200-0017,FRIDAY WENT TO THE LOWER ROOMS WORE MY SPRIGGED MUSLIN ROBE WITH BLUE TRIMMINGS PLAIN BLACK SHOES APPEARED TO MUCH ADVANTAGE,12.57
173-200-0018,BUT WAS STRANGELY HARASSED BY A QUEER HALF WITTED MAN WHO WOULD MAKE ME DANCE WITH HIM AND DISTRESSED ME BY HIS NONSENSE INDEED I SHALL SAY NO SUCH THING,13.76
173-200-0019,IF YOU PLEASE I DANCED WITH A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN INTRODUCED BY MISTER KING HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONVERSATION WITH HIM SEEMS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS,14.215
173-200-0020,HOPE I MAY KNOW MORE OF HIM THAT MADAM IS WHAT I WISH YOU TO SAY BUT PERHAPS I KEEP NO JOURNAL PERHAPS YOU ARE NOT SITTING IN THIS ROOM AND I AM NOT SITTING BY YOU,15.58

173-200-0023,AND CURL OF YOUR HAIR TO BE DESCRIBED IN ALL THEIR DIVERSITIES WITHOUT HAVING CONSTANT RECOURSE TO A JOURNAL MY DEAR MADAM I AM NOT SO IGNORANT OF YOUNG LADIES WAYS AS YOU WISH TO BELIEVE ME,14.93
173-200-0024,IT IS THIS DELIGHTFUL HABIT OF JOURNALING WHICH LARGELY CONTRIBUTES TO FORM THE EASY STYLE OF WRITING FOR WHICH LADIES ARE SO GENERALLY CELEBRATED,10.62
173-200-0025,EVERYBODY ALLOWS THAT THE TALENT OF WRITING AGREEABLE LETTERS IS PECULIARLY FEMALE NATURE MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING BUT I AM SURE IT MUST BE ESSENTIALLY ASSISTED BY THE PRACTICE OF KEEPING A JOURNAL,15.58
173-200-0026,SAID CATHERINE DOUBTINGLY WHETHER LADIES DO WRITE SO MUCH BETTER LETTERS THAN GENTLEMEN THAT IS I SHOULD NOT THINK THE SUPERIORITY WAS ALWAYS ON OUR SIDE,11.31
173-200-0027,IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE USUAL STYLE OF LETTER WRITING AMONG WOMEN IS FAULTLESS EXCEPT IN THREE PARTICULARS AND WHAT ARE THEY A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF SUBJECT,14.23
173-200-0028,A TOTAL INATTENTION TO STOPS AND A VERY FREQUENT IGNORANCE OF GRAMMAR UPON MY WORD I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF DISCLAIMING THE COMPLIMENT YOU DO NOT THINK TOO HIGHLY OF US IN THAT WAY,15.365
173-200-0029,I SHOULD NO MORE LAY IT DOWN AS A GENERAL RULE THAT WOMEN WRITE BETTER LETTERS THAN MEN THAN THAT THEY SING BETTER DUETS OR DRAW BETTER LANDSCAPES IN EVERY POWER OF WHICH TASTE IS THE FOUNDATION,13.37
173-200-0030,EXCELLENCE IS PRETTY FAIRLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SEXES THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY MISSUS ALLEN,7.33
173-200-0031,I AM AFRAID IT HAS TORN A HOLE ALREADY I SHALL BE QUITE SORRY IF IT HAS FOR THIS IS A FAVOURITE GOWN THOUGH IT COST BUT NINE SHILLINGS A YARD THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED IT MADAM,14.955
173-200-0032,SAID MISTER TILNEY LOOKING AT THE MUSLIN,3.06
173-200-0033,PARTICULARLY WELL I ALWAYS BUY MY OWN CRAVATS AND AM ALLOWED TO BE AN EXCELLENT JUDGE AND MY SISTER HAS OFTEN TRUSTED ME IN THE CHOICE OF A GOWN,13.4699375
173-200-0034,I BOUGHT ONE FOR HER THE OTHER DAY AND IT WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE A PRODIGIOUS BARGAIN BY EVERY LADY WHO SAW IT I GAVE BUT FIVE SHILLINGS A YARD FOR IT AND A TRUE INDIAN MUSLIN,14.07
173-200-0035,HOW CAN YOU SAID CATHERINE LAUGHING BE SO SHE HAD ALMOST SAID STRANGE,7.25
173-200-0036,REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN AND SO I TOLD MISS MORLAND WHEN SHE BOUGHT IT BUT THEN YOU KNOW MADAM MUSLIN ALWAYS TURNS TO SOME ACCOUNT OR OTHER MISS MORLAND WILL GET ENOUGH OUT OF IT FOR A HANDKERCHIEF,16.38
173-200-0037,OR A CAP OR A CLOAK MUSLIN CAN NEVER BE SAID TO BE WASTED I HAVE HEARD MY SISTER SAY SO FORTY TIMES WHEN SHE HAS BEEN EXTRAVAGANT IN BUYING MORE THAN SHE WANTED OR CARELESS IN CUTTING IT TO PIECES,16.055
173-200-0038,BATH IS A CHARMING PLACE SIR THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD SHOPS HERE WE ARE SADLY OFF IN THE COUNTRY NOT BUT WHAT WE HAVE VERY GOOD SHOPS IN SALISBURY,13.055
173-200-0039,MISTER ALLEN SAYS IT IS NINE MEASURED NINE BUT I AM SURE IT CANNOT BE MORE THAN EIGHT AND IT IS SUCH A FAG I COME BACK TIRED TO DEATH,12.525
173-200-0040,NOW HERE ONE CAN STEP OUT OF DOORS AND GET A THING IN FIVE MINUTES MISTER TILNEY WAS POLITE ENOUGH TO SEEM INTERESTED IN WHAT SHE SAID AND SHE KEPT HIM ON THE SUBJECT OF MUSLINS TILL THE DANCING RECOMMENCED,15.48
173-200-0041,CATHERINE FEARED AS SHE LISTENED TO THEIR DISCOURSE THAT HE INDULGED HIMSELF A LITTLE TOO MUCH WITH THE FOIBLES OF OTHERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF SO EARNESTLY,11.895
173-200-0042,SAID HE AS THEY WALKED BACK TO THE BALLROOM NOT OF YOUR PARTNER I HOPE FOR BY THAT SHAKE OF THE HEAD YOUR MEDITATIONS ARE NOT SATISFACTORY CATHERINE COLOURED AND SAID,14.97
173-200-0043,I WAS NOT THINKING OF ANYTHING THAT IS ARTFUL AND DEEP TO BE SURE BUT I HAD RATHER BE TOLD AT ONCE THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL ME WELL THEN I WILL NOT THANK YOU,14.565
173-200-0044,FOR NOW WE SHALL SOON BE ACQUAINTED AS I AM AUTHORIZED TO TEASE YOU ON THIS SUBJECT WHENEVER WE MEET AND NOTHING IN THE WORLD ADVANCES INTIMACY SO MUCH THEY DANCED AGAIN,14.02
173-200-0045,AND WHEN THE ASSEMBLY CLOSED PARTED ON THE LADY'S SIDE AT LEAST WITH A STRONG INCLINATION FOR CONTINUING THE ACQUAINTANCE,9.4
173-200-0046,WHETHER SHE THOUGHT OF HIM SO MUCH WHILE SHE DRANK HER WARM WINE AND WATER AND PREPARED HERSELF FOR BED AS TO DREAM OF HIM WHEN THERE CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED,12.38
173-200-0047,BUT I HOPE IT WAS NO MORE THAN IN A SLIGHT SLUMBER OR A MORNING DOZE AT MOST FOR IF IT BE TRUE AS A CELEBRATED WRITER HAS MAINTAINED,11.985
173-200-0048,THAT NO YOUNG LADY CAN BE JUSTIFIED IN FALLING IN LOVE BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN'S LOVE IS DECLARED IT MUST BE VERY IMPROPER THAT A YOUNG LADY SHOULD DREAM OF A GENTLEMAN BEFORE THE GENTLEMAN IS FIRST KNOWN TO HAVE DREAMT OF HER,15.205
173-200-0049,HOW PROPER MISTER TILNEY MIGHT BE AS A DREAMER OR A LOVER HAD NOT YET PERHAPS ENTERED MISTER ALLEN'S HEAD BUT THAT HE WAS NOT OBJECTIONABLE AS A COMMON ACQUAINTANCE FOR HIS YOUNG CHARGE,13.74
173-200-0050,HE WAS ON INQUIRY SATISFIED FOR HE HAD EARLY IN THE EVENING TAKEN PAINS TO KNOW WHO HER PARTNER WAS AND HAD BEEN ASSURED OF MISTER TILNEY'S BEING A CLERGYMAN,12.445
177-122839-0000,POETRY AND PROSE FOR THE NEXT MONTH ANNE LIVED IN WHAT FOR AVONLEA MIGHT BE CALLED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT THE PREPARATION OF HER OWN MODEST OUTFIT FOR REDMOND WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE,14.54
177-122839-0001,MISS LAVENDAR WAS GETTING READY TO BE MARRIED AND THE STONE HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF ENDLESS CONSULTATIONS AND PLANNINGS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH HOVERING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THINGS IN AGITATED DELIGHT AND WONDER THEN THE DRESSMAKER CAME,14.215
177-122839-0002,AND THERE WAS THE RAPTURE AND WRETCHEDNESS OF CHOOSING FASHIONS AND BEING FITTED ANNE AND DIANA SPENT HALF THEIR TIME AT ECHO LODGE AND THERE WERE NIGHTS WHEN ANNE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR WONDERING WHETHER SHE HAD DONE RIGHT IN ADVISING MISS LAVENDAR TO SELECT BROWN RATHER THAN NAVY BLUE FOR HER TRAVELING DRESS,15.87
177-122839-0003,EVERYBODY CONCERNED IN MISS LAVENDAR'S STORY WAS VERY HAPPY,3.67
177-122839-0004,I KNEW I COULD TRUST FATHER TO PICK ME OUT A NICE LITTLE SECOND MOTHER HE SAID PROUDLY IT'S A FINE THING TO HAVE A FATHER YOU CAN DEPEND ON TEACHER I JUST LOVE MISS LAVENDAR GRANDMA IS PLEASED TOO SHE SAYS SHE'S REAL GLAD FATHER DIDN'T PICK OUT AN AMERICAN FOR HIS SECOND WIFE BECAUSE,14.9
177-122839-0005,MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE THOROUGHLY APPROVES OF THE MATCH AND THINKS ITS LIKELY MISS LAVENDAR WILL GIVE UP HER QUEER NOTIONS AND BE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE NOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE MARRIED,8.115
177-122839-0006,YOU KNOW TEACHER CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH WAS ANOTHER RADIANT PERSON OH MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM IT HAS ALL TURNED OUT SO BEAUTIFUL,9.525
177-122839-0007,AIN'T MISTER IRVING SPLENDID HE JUST WORSHIPS THE GROUND SHE TREADS ON AND IT MAKES ME FEEL SO QUEER SOMETIMES TO SEE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE'S WATCHING HER IT BEGGARS DESCRIPTION MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM I'M AWFUL THANKFUL THEY'RE SO FOND OF EACH OTHER IT'S THE BEST WAY WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE,14.065
177-122839-0008,AND WAS HAPPY WITH ALL THREE EXCEPT AT THE TIMES OF THE FUNERALS BUT I THINK SHE TOOK A RESK MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM OH IT'S ALL SO ROMANTIC BREATHED ANNE TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT,10.435
177-122839-0009,SHE WAS AND NEVER ASKED ANYBODY ANYTHING ABOUT HER AND NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME RIGHT AND I HAD A HAND IN BRINGING IT ABOUT PERHAPS AS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS,9.645
177-122839-0010,BUT EVEN SO IT'S NICE TO THINK ONE WAS AN INSTRUMENT USED BY PREDESTINATION YES INDEED IT'S VERY ROMANTIC I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S SO TERRIBLY ROMANTIC AT ALL SAID MARILLA RATHER CRISPLY,13.065
177-122839-0011,MARILLA THOUGHT ANNE WAS TOO WORKED UP ABOUT IT AND HAD PLENTY TO DO WITH GETTING READY FOR COLLEGE WITHOUT TRAIPSING TO ECHO LODGE TWO DAYS OUT OF THREE HELPING MISS LAVENDAR,7.895
177-122839-0012,NOW WHERE IS THE ROMANCE IN ALL THAT OH THERE ISN'T ANY WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY GASPED ANNE RATHER AS IF SOMEBODY HAD THROWN COLD WATER OVER HER I SUPPOSE THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS IN PROSE,12.34
177-122839-0013,BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGH POETRY AND I THINK IT'S NICER ANNE RECOVERED HERSELF AND HER EYES SHONE AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHED,9.81
177-122839-0014,MARILLA GLANCED AT THE RADIANT YOUNG FACE AND REFRAINED FROM FURTHER SARCASTIC COMMENTS PERHAPS SOME REALIZATION CAME TO HER THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE LIKE ANNE THE VISION AND THE FACULTY DIVINE THAT GIFT,13.48
177-122839-0015,WHICH THE WORLD CANNOT BESTOW OR TAKE AWAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE THROUGH SOME TRANSFIGURING OR REVEALING MEDIUM,8.52

177-122839-0017,MARILLA THAT IS ROMANTIC EVEN IN PROSE THERE'S TO BE NOBODY THERE EXCEPT MISSUS IRVING AND PAUL AND GILBERT AND DIANA AND I AND MISS LAVENDAR'S COUSINS,8.635
177-122839-0018,OR FAR WORSE STILL WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN IT,2.985
177-122839-0019,WAITING HAPPILY FOR THE SUMMER TO BRING LIFE AND LAUGHTER BACK TO IT AGAIN THERE WAS MORE ROMANCE IN THE WORLD THAN THAT WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF THE MIDDLE AGED LOVERS OF THE STONE HOUSE,11.555
177-122839-0020,ANNE STUMBLED SUDDENLY ON IT ONE EVENING WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO ORCHARD SLOPE BY THE WOOD CUT AND CAME OUT INTO THE BARRY GARDEN DIANA BARRY AND FRED WRIGHT WERE STANDING TOGETHER UNDER THE BIG WILLOW DIANA WAS LEANING AGAINST THE GRAY TRUNK HER LASHES CAST DOWN ON VERY CRIMSON CHEEKS,16.74
177-122839-0021,ONE HAND WAS HELD BY FRED WHO STOOD WITH HIS FACE BENT TOWARD HER STAMMERING SOMETHING IN LOW EARNEST TONES THERE WERE NO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THEIR TWO SELVES AT THAT MAGIC MOMENT SO NEITHER OF THEM SAW ANNE WHO AFTER ONE,14.9
177-122839-0022,DAZED GLANCE OF COMPREHENSION TURNED AND SPED NOISELESSLY BACK THROUGH THE SPRUCE WOOD NEVER STOPPING TILL SHE GAINED HER OWN GABLE ROOM WHERE SHE SAT BREATHLESSLY DOWN BY HER WINDOW AND TRIED TO COLLECT HER SCATTERED WITS DIANA AND FRED ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER,15.145
177-122839-0023,SHE GASPED OH IT DOES SEEM SO SO SO HOPELESSLY GROWN UP ANNE OF LATE HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT HER SUSPICIONS THAT DIANA WAS PROVING FALSE TO THE MELANCHOLY BYRONIC HERO OF HER EARLY DREAMS,15.85
177-122839-0024,BUT AS THINGS SEEN ARE MIGHTIER THAN THINGS HEARD OR SUSPECTED THE REALIZATION THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY SO CAME TO HER WITH ALMOST THE SHOCK OF PERFECT SURPRISE THIS WAS SUCCEEDED BY A QUEER LITTLE LONELY FEELING,15.595
177-122839-0025,AS IF SOMEHOW DIANA HAD GONE FORWARD INTO A NEW WORLD SHUTTING A GATE BEHIND HER LEAVING ANNE ON THE OUTSIDE THINGS ARE CHANGING SO FAST IT ALMOST FRIGHTENS ME ANNE THOUGHT A LITTLE SADLY AND I'M AFRAID,15.06
177-122839-0026,THAT THIS CAN'T HELP MAKING SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIANA AND ME I'M SURE I CAN'T TELL HER ALL MY SECRETS AFTER THIS SHE MIGHT TELL FRED AND,9.685
177-122839-0027,HE'S VERY NICE AND JOLLY BUT HE'S JUST FRED WRIGHT IT IS ALWAYS A VERY PUZZLING QUESTION WHAT CAN SOMEBODY SEE IN SOMEBODY ELSE BUT HOW FORTUNATE AFTER ALL THAT IT IS SO FOR IF EVERYBODY SAW ALIKE WELL,16.275
177-122839-0028,IN THAT CASE AS THE OLD INDIAN SAID EVERYBODY WOULD WANT MY SQUAW IT WAS PLAIN THAT DIANA DID SEE SOMETHING IN FRED WRIGHT HOWEVER ANNE'S EYES MIGHT BE HOLDEN DIANA CAME TO GREEN GABLES THE NEXT EVENING A PENSIVE SHY YOUNG LADY,16.26

177-122839-0031,IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY TO BE ENGAGED TO FRED,2.635

177-122839-0033,NEVER MIND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMETIME WHEN YOUR OWN TURN COMES BLESS YOU DEAREST OF DIANAS I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT IS AN IMAGINATION FOR IF NOT TO ENABLE YOU TO PEEP AT LIFE THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES,12.315

177-122839-0038,I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP HOUSE WITH ONLY THIRTY SIX DOILIES CONCEDED ANNE WITH A SOLEMN FACE BUT DANCING EYES DIANA LOOKED HURT I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D MAKE FUN OF ME ANNE SHE SAID REPROACHFULLY DEAREST I WASN'T MAKING FUN OF YOU,15.47

177-122839-0040,ANNE HAD NO SOONER UTTERED THE PHRASE HOME O'DREAMS THAN IT CAPTIVATED HER FANCY AND SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THE ERECTION OF ONE OF HER OWN IT WAS OF COURSE TENANTED BY AN IDEAL MASTER DARK PROUD AND MELANCHOLY,14.62
177-122839-0041,HELPING HER ARRANGE PICTURES LAY OUT GARDENS AND ACCOMPLISH SUNDRY OTHER TASKS WHICH A PROUD AND MELANCHOLY HERO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED BENEATH HIS DIGNITY ANNE TRIED TO,11.9

177-122839-0043,THE TALL SLENDER KIND BUT SOMEHOW I WOULDN'T WANT FRED TO BE TALL AND SLENDER BECAUSE DON'T YOU SEE HE WOULDN'T BE FRED THEN OF COURSE ADDED DIANA RATHER DOLEFULLY WE WILL BE A DREADFULLY PUDGY COUPLE,14.275
177-122839-0044,BUT AFTER ALL THAT'S BETTER THAN ONE OF US BEING SHORT AND FAT AND THE OTHER TALL AND LEAN LIKE MORGAN SLOANE AND HIS WIFE MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT ALWAYS MAKES HER THINK OF THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT WHEN SHE SEES THEM TOGETHER WELL SAID ANNE TO HERSELF THAT NIGHT AS SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR BEFORE HER GILT FRAMED MIRROR,16.78
177-122839-0045,I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE,13.44
177-123525-0000,CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN FROM JOY TO DEATH FOR TEN DAYS THE HORDES OF THARK AND THEIR WILD ALLIES WERE FEASTED AND ENTERTAINED AND THEN LOADED WITH COSTLY PRESENTS,13.63
177-123525-0001,THEY STARTED ON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THEIR OWN LANDS THE JED OF LESSER HELIUM WITH A SMALL PARTY OF NOBLES ACCOMPANIED THEM ALL THE WAY TO THARK TO CEMENT MORE CLOSELY THE NEW BONDS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP,13.8

177-123525-0006,WHEN THE DELICATE SHELL SHOULD BREAK VIVID IN MY MEMORY IS THE PICTURE OF THE LAST NIGHT AS WE SAT THERE TALKING IN LOW TONES OF THE STRANGE ROMANCE WHICH HAD WOVEN OUR LIVES TOGETHER AND OF THIS WONDER WHICH WAS COMING TO AUGMENT OUR HAPPINESS,15.29
177-123525-0007,AND FULFILL OUR HOPES IN THE DISTANCE WE SAW THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT OF AN APPROACHING AIRSHIP BUT WE ATTACHED NO SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO SO COMMON A SIGHT LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING IT RACED TOWARD HELIUM UNTIL ITS VERY SPEED,15.425
177-123525-0008,BESPOKE THE UNUSUAL FLASHING THE SIGNALS WHICH PROCLAIMED IT A DISPATCH BEARER FOR THE JEDDAK IT CIRCLED IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE TARDY PATROL BOAT WHICH MUST CONVOY IT TO THE PALACE DOCKS,12.235
177-123525-0009,A MESSAGE CALLED ME TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER WHICH I FOUND FILLING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THAT BODY ON THE RAISED PLATFORM OF THE THRONE,7.685
177-123525-0010,PACING BACK AND FORTH WITH TENSE DRAWN FACE WHEN ALL WERE IN THEIR SEATS HE TURNED TOWARD US THIS MORNING HE SAID,8.84
177-123525-0011,THAT THE KEEPER OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT HAD MADE NO WIRELESS REPORT FOR TWO DAYS NOR HAD ALMOST CEASELESS CALLS UPON HIM FROM A SCORE OF CAPITALS ELICITED A SIGN OF RESPONSE THE AMBASSADORS OF THE OTHER NATIONS ASKED US TO TAKE THE MATTER IN HAND,14.685
177-123525-0012,AND HASTEN THE ASSISTANT KEEPER TO THE PLANT ALL DAY A THOUSAND CRUISERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM UNTIL JUST NOW ONE OF THEM RETURNS BEARING HIS DEAD BODY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE PITS BENEATH HIS HOUSE HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY SOME ASSASSIN,15.62
177-123525-0013,I DO NOT NEED TO TELL YOU WHAT THIS MEANS TO BARSOOM IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO PENETRATE THOSE MIGHTY WALLS IN FACT THE WORK HAS ALREADY COMMENCED AND THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO FEAR WERE THE ENGINE OF THE PUMPING PLANT TO RUN AS IT SHOULD,13.56
177-123525-0014,BUT THE WORST WE FEAR HAS HAPPENED THE INSTRUMENTS SHOW A RAPIDLY DECREASING AIR PRESSURE ON ALL PARTS OF BARSOOM THE ENGINE HAS STOPPED MY GENTLEMEN HE CONCLUDED WE HAVE AT BEST THREE DAYS TO LIVE,15.995
177-123525-0015,THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN A YOUNG NOBLE AROSE,5.04
177-123525-0016,NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEM HOW THEY SHOULD DIE LET US GO ABOUT OUR DUTIES AS THOUGH A THOUSAND USEFUL YEARS STILL LAY BEFORE US THE CHAMBER RANG WITH APPLAUSE,13.205
177-123525-0017,WE WENT OUR WAYS WITH SMILES UPON OUR FACES AND SORROW GNAWING AT OUR HEARTS,5.335

177-123525-0019,THE NEXT TWO DAYS BROUGHT NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY OF AIR,4.215
177-123525-0020,THE AVENUES AND PLAZAS OF HELIUM WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE ALL BUSINESS HAD CEASED FOR THE MOST PART THE PEOPLE LOOKED BRAVELY INTO THE FACE OF THEIR UNALTERABLE DOOM HERE AND THERE HOWEVER MEN AND WOMEN GAVE WAY TO QUIET GRIEF,15.935
177-123525-0021,TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY MANY OF THE WEAKER COMMENCED TO SUCCUMB AND WITHIN AN HOUR THE PEOPLE OF BARSOOM WERE SINKING BY THOUSANDS INTO THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHICH PRECEDES DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION,13.93
177-123525-0022,DEJAH THORIS AND I WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY HAD COLLECTED IN A SUNKEN GARDEN WITHIN AN INNER COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WE CONVERSED IN LOW TONES WHEN WE CONVERSED AT ALL,12.845
177-123525-0023,AS THE AWE OF THE GRIM SHADOW OF DEATH CREPT OVER US EVEN WOOLA SEEMED TO FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE IMPENDING CALAMITY FOR HE PRESSED CLOSE TO DEJAH THORIS AND TO ME WHINING PITIFULLY,14.065
177-123525-0024,THAT NOW SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW AS IT WAS BECOMING PERCEPTIBLY DIFFICULT TO BREATHE TARDOS MORS AROSE SAYING LET US BID EACH OTHER FAREWELL THE DAYS OF THE GREATNESS OF BARSOOM ARE OVER,13.92
177-123525-0025,WHICH THROUGH ALL ETERNITY MUST GO SWINGING THROUGH THE HEAVENS PEOPLED NOT EVEN BY MEMORIES IT IS THE END,10.585
177-123525-0026,HE STOOPED AND KISSED THE WOMEN OF HIS FAMILY AND LAID HIS STRONG HAND UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE MEN AS I TURNED SADLY FROM HIM MY EYES FELL UPON DEJAH THORIS HER HEAD WAS DROOPING UPON HER BREAST TO ALL APPEARANCES SHE WAS LIFELESS,15.375
177-123525-0027,HER EYES OPENED AND LOOKED INTO MINE KISS ME JOHN CARTER SHE MURMURED I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU IT IS CRUEL THAT WE MUST BE TORN APART WHO WERE JUST STARTING UPON,12.8
177-123525-0028,AS I PRESSED HER DEAR LIPS TO MINE THE OLD FEELING OF UNCONQUERABLE POWER AND AUTHORITY ROSE IN ME THE FIGHTING BLOOD OF VIRGINIA SPRANG TO LIFE IN MY VEINS IT SHALL NOT BE MY PRINCESS,14.145
177-123525-0029,I CRIED THERE IS THERE MUST BE SOME WAY AND JOHN CARTER WHO HAS FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A STRANGE WORLD FOR LOVE OF YOU WILL FIND IT AND WITH MY WORDS THERE CREPT ABOVE THE THRESHOLD OF MY CONSCIOUS MIND A SERIES OF,14.435
177-123525-0030,NINE LONG FORGOTTEN SOUNDS LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE DARKNESS THEIR FULL PURPORT DAWNED UPON ME,7.96
177-123525-0031,HE DID NOT WAIT TO QUESTION BUT IN AN INSTANT A GUARD WAS RACING TO THE NEAREST DOCK AND THOUGH THE AIR WAS THIN AND ALMOST GONE AT THE ROOFTOP THEY MANAGED TO LAUNCH THE FASTEST ONE MAN AIR SCOUT MACHINE THAT THE SKILL OF BARSOOM HAD EVER PRODUCED,13.89
177-123525-0032,KISSING DEJAH THORIS A DOZEN TIMES AND COMMANDING WOOLA WHO WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED ME TO REMAIN AND GUARD HER I BOUNDED WITH MY OLD AGILITY AND STRENGTH TO THE HIGH RAMPARTS OF THE PALACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I WAS HEADED TOWARD THE GOAL OF THE HOPES OF,14.845
177-123525-0033,ALL BARSOOM I HAD TO FLY LOW TO GET SUFFICIENT AIR TO BREATHE BUT I TOOK A STRAIGHT COURSE ACROSS AN OLD SEA BOTTOM AND SO HAD TO RISE ONLY A FEW FEET ABOVE THE GROUND I TRAVELED WITH AWFUL VELOCITY FOR MY ERRAND WAS A RACE AGAINST TIME WITH DEATH,15.725
177-123525-0034,THE FACE OF DEJAH THORIS HUNG ALWAYS BEFORE ME AS I TURNED FOR A LAST LOOK AS I LEFT THE PALACE GARDEN I HAD SEEN HER STAGGER AND SINK UPON THE GROUND BESIDE THE LITTLE INCUBATOR THAT SHE HAD DROPPED INTO THE LAST COMA WHICH WOULD END IN DEATH,13.815
177-123525-0035,IF THE AIR SUPPLY REMAINED UNREPLENISHED I WELL KNEW AND SO THROWING CAUTION TO THE WINDS I FLUNG OVERBOARD EVERYTHING BUT THE ENGINE AND COMPASS,8.695
177-123525-0036,PUSHING THE SPEED LEVER TO ITS LAST NOTCH I SPLIT THE THIN AIR OF DYING MARS WITH THE SPEED OF A METEOR AN HOUR BEFORE DARK THE GREAT WALLS OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT LOOMED SUDDENLY BEFORE ME AND WITH A SICKENING,13.36
177-123525-0037,WHICH WAS WITHHOLDING THE SPARK OF LIFE FROM THE INHABITANTS OF AN ENTIRE PLANET BESIDE THE DOOR A GREAT CREW OF MEN HAD BEEN LABORING TO PIERCE THE WALL BUT THEY HAD SCARCELY SCRATCHED THE FLINT LIKE SURFACE,10.855
177-123525-0038,CONDITIONS SEEMED MUCH WORSE HERE THAN AT HELIUM AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I BREATHED AT ALL THERE WERE A FEW MEN STILL CONSCIOUS AND TO ONE OF THESE I SPOKE IF I CAN OPEN THESE DOORS IS THERE A MAN WHO CAN START THE ENGINES I ASKED I CAN,15.525
177-123525-0039,HE REPLIED IF YOU OPEN QUICKLY I CAN LAST BUT A FEW MOMENTS MORE BUT IT IS USELESS THEY ARE BOTH DEAD AND NO ONE ELSE UPON BARSOOM KNEW THE SECRET OF THESE AWFUL LOCKS FOR THREE DAYS,11.77
177-123525-0040,MEN CRAZED WITH FEAR HAVE SURGED ABOUT THIS PORTAL IN VAIN ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE ITS MYSTERY I HAD NO TIME TO TALK I WAS BECOMING VERY WEAK AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I CONTROLLED MY MIND AT ALL BUT WITH A FINAL EFFORT AS I SANK WEAKLY TO MY KNEES I HURLED,15.52
177-123525-0041,THE NINE THOUGHT WAVES AT THAT AWFUL THING BEFORE ME THE MARTIAN HAD CRAWLED TO MY SIDE AND WITH STARING EYES FIXED ON THE SINGLE PANEL BEFORE US WE WAITED IN THE SILENCE OF DEATH SLOWLY,13.96
177-123525-0042,I WAS TOO WEAK AFTER IT I CRIED TO MY COMPANION AND IF YOU REACH THE PUMP ROOM TURN LOOSE ALL THE PUMPS IT IS THE ONLY CHANCE BARSOOM HAS TO EXIST TOMORROW FROM WHERE I LAY I OPENED THE SECOND DOOR,15.555
177-123525-0043,AND THEN THE THIRD AND AS I SAW THE HOPE OF BARSOOM CRAWLING,4.45
177-123525-0044,I SANK UNCONSCIOUS,2.07
177-55218-0000,CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM FEBRUARY CAME THE OPERETTA FOR WHICH BILLY WAS WORKING SO HARD WAS TO BE GIVEN THE TWENTIETH THE ART EXHIBITION FOR WHICH BERTRAM WAS PREPARING HIS FOUR PICTURES WAS TO OPEN THE SIXTEENTH,14.995
177-55218-0001,WITH A PRIVATE VIEW FOR SPECIALLY INVITED FRIENDS THE EVENING BEFORE ON THE ELEVENTH DAY OF FEBRUARY MISSUS GREGGORY AND HER DAUGHTER ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE FOR A TEN DAYS VISIT NOT UNTIL AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PLEADING AND ARGUMENT HOWEVER HAD BILLY BEEN ABLE TO BRING THIS ABOUT,13.915
177-55218-0002,BUT MY DEARS BOTH OF YOU BILLY HAD AT LAST SAID TO THEM JUST LISTEN WE SHALL HAVE,5.795
177-55218-0003,AND WILL HAVE TO STAY ALL NIGHT SEVERAL TIMES PROBABLY YOU MISSUS GREGGORY,4.74
177-55218-0004,IT HAD BEEN THE GREAT GOOD AND PLEASURE WHICH THE VISIT WOULD BRING TO MISSUS GREGGORY THAT HAD BEEN THE FINAL STRAW TO TIP THE SCALES ON THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY THEREFORE IN THE COMPANY OF THE ONCE SCORNED PEGGY AND MARY JANE ALICE GREGGORY AND HER MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE,16.045
177-55218-0005,EVER SINCE THE FIRST MEETING OF ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT BILLY HAD BEEN SORELY TROUBLED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE SHE HAD AS SHE MOURNFULLY TOLD HERSELF,9.5149375
177-55218-0006,THE TWO WERE CIVILITY ITSELF TO EACH OTHER BUT VERY PLAINLY THEY WERE NOT AT EASE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AND BILLY MUCH TO HER SURPRISE HAD TO ADMIT THAT ARKWRIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO APPRECIATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW THAT HE HAD THEM THE PAIR CALLED EACH OTHER CEREMONIOUSLY,15.745
177-55218-0007,MISTER ARKWRIGHT AND MISS GREGGORY BUT THEN THAT OF COURSE DID NOT SIGNIFY BILLY DECLARED TO HERSELF I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T EVER CALL HIM MARY JANE SHE SAID TO THE GIRL A LITTLE MISCHIEVOUSLY ONE DAY MARY JANE MISTER ARKWRIGHT NO I DON'T,15.685
177-55218-0008,REJOINED MISS GREGGORY WITH AN ODD SMILE THEN AFTER A MOMENT SHE ADDED I BELIEVE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS USED TO HOWEVER YES I KNOW LAUGHED BILLY WE THOUGHT HE WAS A REAL MARY JANE ONCE AND SHE TOLD THE STORY OF HIS ARRIVAL,13.185
177-55218-0009,SO YOU SEE SHE FINISHED WHEN ALICE GREGGORY HAD DONE LAUGHING OVER THE TALE,4.31
177-55218-0010,MISS GREGGORY LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE WHY IT'S SHE STOPPED SHORT HER EYES QUESTIONING WHY HASN'T HE EVER TOLD YOU SHE QUERIED BILLY LIFTED HER CHIN NO,11.35
177-55218-0011,METHUSELAH JOHN BUT HE SAYS WE HAVEN'T HIT IT YET METHUSELAH JOHN INDEED LAUGHED THE OTHER MERRILY,6.64
177-55218-0012,IF IT ISN'T METHUSELAH JOHN WHAT IS IT THEN BUT ALICE GREGGORY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE TOO IT SEEMED COULD BE FIRM ON OCCASION AND THOUGH SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY ALL SHE WOULD SAY WAS IF HE HASN'T TOLD YOU I SHA'N'T YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO HIM,14.61
177-55218-0013,OH WELL I CAN STILL CALL HIM MARY JANE RETORTED BILLY WITH AIRY DISDAIN ALL THIS HOWEVER SO FAR AS BILLY COULD SEE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST HELPING ALONG THE CAUSE THAT HAD BECOME SO DEAR TO HER,11.035
177-55218-0014,YES THE QUIETLY POLITE MONOSYLLABLE WAS NOT VERY ENCOURAGING TO BE SURE BUT BILLY SECURE IN HER CONVICTION THAT HER CAUSE WAS A RIGHTEOUS ONE REFUSED TO BE DAUNTED I THINK IT WAS SO ROMANTIC,13.105
177-55218-0015,THEIR RUNNING ACROSS EACH OTHER LIKE THIS MISSUS GREGGORY SHE MURMURED AND THERE WAS A ROMANCE WASN'T THERE I HAVE JUST FELT IN MY BONES THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE BILLY HELD HER BREATH IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD MEANT TO SAY BUT NOW THAT SHE HAD SAID IT THE WORDS SEEMED,15.755
177-55218-0016,VERY FEARSOME INDEED TO SAY TO MISSUS GREGGORY THEN BILLY REMEMBERED HER CAUSE AND TOOK HEART BILLY WAS SPELLING IT NOW WITH A CAPITAL C FOR A LONG MINUTE MISSUS GREGGORY DID NOT ANSWER FOR SO LONG A MINUTE,14.405
177-55218-0017,THAT BILLY'S BREATH DROPPED INTO A FLUTTERING SIGH AND HER CAUSE BECAME SUDDENLY IMPERTINENCE SPELLED IN BLACK CAPITALS THEN MISSUS GREGGORY SPOKE SLOWLY A LITTLE SADLY I DON'T MIND SAYING TO YOU THAT I DID HOPE,15.64
177-55218-0018,ONCE THAT THERE WOULD BE A ROMANCE THERE THEY WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS AND THEY WERE WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER IN TASTES AND TEMPERAMENT I THINK INDEED THAT THE ROMANCE WAS WELL UNDER WAY THOUGH THERE WAS NEVER AN ENGAGEMENT WHEN MISSUS GREGGORY PAUSED AND WET HER LIPS,16.315
177-55218-0019,HER VOICE WHEN SHE RESUMED CARRIED THE STERN NOTE SO FAMILIAR TO BILLY IN HER FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER AS I PRESUME MISTER ARKWRIGHT HAS TOLD YOU WE HAVE MET WITH MANY CHANGES IN OUR LIFE CHANGES WHICH NECESSITATED A NEW HOME AND A NEW MODE OF LIVING,15.47
177-55218-0020,NATURALLY UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OLD FRIENDS AND OLD ROMANCES MUST CHANGE TOO BUT MISSUS GREGGORY STAMMERED BILLY I'M SURE MISTER ARKWRIGHT WOULD WANT AN UP LIFTED HAND SILENCED HER PEREMPTORILY,13.69
177-55218-0021,MISTER ARKWRIGHT WAS VERY KIND AND A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS INTERPOSED THE LADY COLDLY BUT JUDGE GREGGORY'S DAUGHTER WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PLACED WHERE APOLOGIES FOR HER FATHER WOULD BE NECESSARY EVER THERE PLEASE,15.35
177-55218-0022,DEAR MISS NEILSON LET US NOT TALK OF IT ANY MORE BEGGED MISSUS GREGGORY BROKENLY NO INDEED OF COURSE NOT CRIED BILLY BUT HER HEART REJOICED SHE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL NOW,11.97
177-55218-0023,ARKWRIGHT AND ALICE GREGGORY HAD BEEN ALMOST LOVERS WHEN THE CHARGES AGAINST THE JUDGE'S HONOR HAD PLUNGED THE FAMILY INTO DESPAIRING HUMILIATION THEN HAD COME THE TIME WHEN ACCORDING TO ARKWRIGHT'S OWN STORY THE TWO WOMEN HAD SHUT THEMSELVES INDOORS REFUSED TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS AND LEFT TOWN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,15.65
177-55218-0024,THUS HAD COME THE BREAKING OF WHATEVER TIE THERE WAS BETWEEN ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT NOT TO HAVE BROKEN IT WOULD HAVE MEANT FOR ALICE THE PLACING OF HERSELF IN A POSITION WHERE SOMETIME APOLOGIES MUST BE MADE FOR HER FATHER,11.85
177-55218-0025,AND AGAIN AS BILLY THOUGHT OF IT BILLY'S HEART REJOICED,4.1
177-55218-0026,DID SHE NOT HAVE IT IN HER POWER POSSIBLY EVEN PROBABLY TO BRING HAPPINESS WHERE ONLY SADNESS WAS BEFORE AS IF IT WOULD NOT BE A SIMPLE THING TO REKINDLE THE OLD FLAME TO MAKE THESE TWO ESTRANGED HEARTS BEAT AS ONE AGAIN,13.755
177-55218-0027,NOT NOW WAS THE CAUSE AN IMPERTINENCE IN TALL BLACK LETTERS IT WAS INSTEAD A SHINING BEACON IN LETTERS OF FLAME GUIDING STRAIGHT TO VICTORY,12.155
177-55218-0028,BILLY WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT MAKING PLANS FOR ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT TO BE THROWN TOGETHER NATURALLY JUST AS A MATTER OF COURSE YOU KNOW SHE SAID DROWSILY TO HERSELF ALL IN THE DARK SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY DOWN BEACON STREET AT THAT MOMENT,14.35
177-55218-0029,BERTRAM HENSHAW IN THE STRATA WAS AS IT HAPPENED NOT FALLING ASLEEP HE WAS LYING BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE BERTRAM VERY FREQUENTLY LAY BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE THESE DAYS OR RATHER NIGHTS HE TOLD HIMSELF ON THESE OCCASIONS,15.83
177-55218-0030,WITH ARKWRIGHT AND HIS FRIENDS THE GREGGORYS SO MUCH THERE WERE THE NEW SONGS AND THE OPERETTA WITH ITS REHEARSALS AS A CAUSE FOR IT ALL AT THE SAME TIME DEEP WITHIN HIS FEARFUL SOUL WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ARKWRIGHT THE GREGGORYS AND THE OPERETTA WERE BUT,15.89
177-55218-0031,MUSIC MUSIC THE SPECTRE THAT FROM THE FIRST HAD DOGGED HIS FOOTSTEPS WITH BILLY'S BEHAVIOR TOWARD HIMSELF BERTRAM COULD FIND NO FAULT SHE WAS ALWAYS HER SWEET LOYAL LOVABLE SELF EAGER TO HEAR OF HIS WORK,15.06
177-55218-0032,EARNESTLY SOLICITOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESS SHE EVEN AS HE SOMETIMES HALF IRRITABLY REMEMBERED HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT SHE REALIZED HE BELONGED TO ART BEFORE HE DID TO HIMSELF AND WHEN HE HAD INDIGNANTLY DENIED THIS SHE HAD ONLY LAUGHED AND THROWN A KISS AT HIM,15.075
177-55218-0033,AS IF HE WANTED KATE'S OPINION ON THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CONCERNED HIM AND BILLY ONCE TORN BY JEALOUSY AND EXASPERATED AT THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS OF THEIR QUIET HOURS TOGETHER HE HAD COMPLAINED OPENLY ACTUALLY BILLY IT'S WORSE THAN MARIE'S WEDDING HE DECLARED,15.43
177-55218-0034,BILLY LAUGHED BUT SHE FROWNED TOO I KNOW DEAR I DON'T LIKE THAT PART I WISH THEY WOULD LET ME ALONE WHEN I'M WITH YOU BUT AS FOR THE OPERETTA IT IS REALLY A GOOD THING DEAR AND YOU'LL SAY SO WHEN YOU SEE IT,10.565
177-55218-0035,I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE MY PART IS ONLY A SMALL ONE YOU KNOW WE SHALL MAKE LOTS OF MONEY FOR THE HOME TOO I'M SURE BUT YOU'RE WEARING YOURSELF ALL OUT WITH IT DEAR SCOWLED BERTRAM,9.845
177-55218-0036,BESIDES WHEN I'M DOING THIS I'M NOT TELEPHONING YOU TO COME AND AMUSE ME,3.475
177-55218-0037,AVOWED BERTRAM BUT THE WORK MAY RETORTED BILLY SHOWING ALL HER DIMPLES,5.345
177-55218-0038,THIS ISN'T AN UNDERSTUDY LIKE MARIE'S WEDDING YOU KNOW SHE FINISHED DEMURELY THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT BERTRAM HAD BREATHED FERVENTLY BUT EVEN AS HE SAID THE WORDS HE GREW SICK WITH FEAR WHAT IF AFTER ALL THIS WERE AN UNDERSTUDY TO WHAT WAS TO COME LATER WHEN MUSIC,16.74
177-55218-0039,HIS RIVAL HAD REALLY CONQUERED BERTRAM KNEW THAT HOWEVER SECURE MIGHT SEEM BILLY'S AFFECTION FOR HIMSELF THERE WAS STILL IN HIS OWN MIND A HORRID FEAR LEST UNDERNEATH THAT SECURITY WERE AN UNCONSCIOUS,14.655
177-55218-0040,SOME ONE THAT HE WAS NOT A FONDNESS THAT WOULD ONE DAY CAUSE BILLY TO AWAKE,6.62
199-131001-0000,THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED THE IDEA OF RESTRAINING THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IN REGARD TO THE COMMON DEFENSE CONSIDERED FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN,14.58
199-131001-0001,HAMILTON TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,4.15
199-131001-0002,OUR OWN EXPERIENCE HAS CORROBORATED THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY THE EXAMPLES OF OTHER NATIONS THAT EMERGENCIES OF THIS SORT WILL SOMETIMES ARISE IN ALL SOCIETIES HOWEVER CONSTITUTED,12.175
199-131001-0003,THAT SEDITIONS AND INSURRECTIONS ARE UNHAPPILY MALADIES AS INSEPARABLE FROM THE BODY POLITIC AS TUMORS AND ERUPTIONS FROM THE NATURAL BODY THAT THE IDEA OF GOVERNING AT ALL TIMES BY THE SIMPLE FORCE OF LAW,15.355
199-131001-0004,WHICH WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IS THE ONLY ADMISSIBLE PRINCIPLE OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT HAS NO PLACE BUT IN THE REVERIES OF THOSE POLITICAL DOCTORS WHOSE SAGACITY DISDAINS THE ADMONITIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL INSTRUCTION,13.005
199-131001-0005,SHOULD SUCH EMERGENCIES AT ANY TIME HAPPEN UNDER THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THERE COULD BE NO REMEDY BUT FORCE THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED MUST BE PROPORTIONED TO THE EXTENT OF THE MISCHIEF IF IT SHOULD BE A SLIGHT COMMOTION IN A SMALL PART OF A STATE,14.9
199-131001-0006,AN INSURRECTION WHATEVER MAY BE ITS IMMEDIATE CAUSE EVENTUALLY ENDANGERS ALL GOVERNMENT REGARD TO THE PUBLIC PEACE IF NOT TO THE RIGHTS OF THE UNION WOULD ENGAGE THE CITIZENS TO WHOM THE CONTAGION HAD NOT COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO OPPOSE THE INSURGENTS,15.875
199-131001-0007,IT WERE IRRATIONAL TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO ITS SUPPORT IF ON THE CONTRARY THE INSURRECTION SHOULD PERVADE A WHOLE STATE OR A PRINCIPAL PART OF IT THE EMPLOYMENT OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF FORCE MIGHT BECOME UNAVOIDABLE,15.935
199-131001-0008,IT APPEARS THAT MASSACHUSETTS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RAISE TROOPS FOR REPRESSING THE DISORDERS WITHIN THAT STATE THAT PENNSYLVANIA FROM THE MERE APPREHENSION OF COMMOTIONS AMONG A PART OF HER CITIZENS HAS THOUGHT PROPER TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE SAME MEASURE,14.01
199-131001-0009,COULD SHE HAVE HOPED FOR SUCCESS IN SUCH AN ENTERPRISE FROM THE EFFORTS OF THE MILITIA ALONE,5.245
199-131001-0010,IF IT MUST THEN BE ADMITTED THAT THE NECESSITY OF RECURRING TO A FORCE DIFFERENT FROM THE MILITIA IN CASES OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY NATURE IS APPLICABLE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES WHY SHOULD THE POSSIBILITY,12.51
199-131001-0011,THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE UNDER A LIKE NECESSITY IN SIMILAR EXTREMITIES BE MADE AN OBJECTION TO ITS EXISTENCE IS IT NOT SURPRISING THAT MEN WHO DECLARE AN ATTACHMENT TO THE UNION IN THE ABSTRACT SHOULD URGE AS AN OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION,14.67
199-131001-0012,WHAT APPLIES WITH TENFOLD WEIGHT TO THE PLAN FOR WHICH THEY CONTEND AND WHAT AS FAR AS IT HAS ANY FOUNDATION IN TRUTH IS AN INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF CIVIL SOCIETY UPON AN ENLARGED SCALE,11.765
199-131001-0013,WHO WOULD NOT PREFER THAT POSSIBILITY TO THE UNCEASING AGITATIONS AND FREQUENT REVOLUTIONS WHICH ARE THE CONTINUAL SCOURGES OF PETTY REPUBLICS LET US PURSUE THIS EXAMINATION IN ANOTHER LIGHT SUPPOSE IN LIEU OF ONE GENERAL SYSTEM,15.33
199-131001-0014,WOULD NOT THE SAME DIFFICULTY OPPOSE ITSELF TO THE OPERATIONS OF EITHER OF THESE CONFEDERACIES WOULD NOT EACH OF THEM BE EXPOSED TO THE SAME CASUALTIES,9.425
199-131001-0015,AND WHEN THESE HAPPENED BE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE SAME EXPEDIENTS FOR UPHOLDING ITS AUTHORITY WHICH ARE OBJECTED TO IN A GOVERNMENT FOR ALL THE STATES WOULD THE MILITIA IN THIS SUPPOSITION,11.14
199-131001-0016,ALL CANDID AND INTELLIGENT MEN MUST UPON DUE CONSIDERATION ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE OBJECTION IS EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO EITHER OF THE TWO CASES AND THAT WHETHER WE HAVE ONE GOVERNMENT FOR ALL THE STATES OR DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS FOR DIFFERENT PARCELS OF THEM,15.695
199-131001-0017,WHICH AMOUNT TO INSURRECTIONS AND REBELLIONS INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER REASONINGS UPON THE SUBJECT,5.835
199-131001-0018,TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE POWER OF THE PROPOSED GOVERNMENT IS TO BE IN THE HANDS OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE THIS IS THE ESSENTIAL AND AFTER ALL ONLY EFFICACIOUS SECURITY FOR THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE WHICH IS ATTAINABLE IN CIVIL SOCIETY,15.845
199-131001-0019,THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE BETRAY THEIR CONSTITUENTS THERE IS THEN NO RESOURCE LEFT BUT IN THE EXERTION OF THAT ORIGINAL RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE WHICH IS PARAMOUNT TO ALL POSITIVE FORMS OF GOVERNMENT,12.635
199-131001-0020,AND WHICH AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF THE NATIONAL RULERS MAY BE EXERTED WITH INFINITELY BETTER PROSPECT OF SUCCESS THAN AGAINST THOSE OF THE RULERS OF AN INDIVIDUAL STATE IN A SINGLE STATE IF THE PERSONS INTRUSTED WITH SUPREME POWER BECOME USURPERS,15.53
199-131001-0021,THE DIFFERENT PARCELS SUBDIVISIONS OR DISTRICTS OF WHICH IT CONSISTS,4.23
199-131001-0022,WITHOUT CONCERT WITHOUT SYSTEM WITHOUT RESOURCE EXCEPT IN THEIR COURAGE AND DESPAIR THE USURPERS CLOTHED WITH THE FORMS OF LEGAL AUTHORITY CAN TOO OFTEN CRUSH THE OPPOSITION IN EMBRYO THE SMALLER THE EXTENT OF THE TERRITORY,14.085
199-131001-0023,THE MORE DIFFICULT WILL IT BE FOR THE PEOPLE TO FORM A REGULAR OR SYSTEMATIC PLAN OF OPPOSITION,5.325
199-131001-0024,INTELLIGENCE CAN BE MORE SPEEDILY OBTAINED OF THEIR PREPARATIONS AND MOVEMENTS AND THE MILITARY FORCE IN THE POSSESSION OF THE USURPERS CAN BE MORE RAPIDLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE PART WHERE THE OPPOSITION HAS BEGUN,11.74
199-131001-0025,PROVIDED THE CITIZENS UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS AND ARE DISPOSED TO DEFEND THEM THE NATURAL STRENGTH OF THE PEOPLE IN A LARGE COMMUNITY,8.07
199-131001-0026,TO ESTABLISH A TYRANNY BUT IN A CONFEDERACY THE PEOPLE WITHOUT EXAGGERATION MAY BE SAID TO BE ENTIRELY THE MASTERS OF THEIR OWN FATE POWER BEING ALMOST ALWAYS THE RIVAL OF POWER,11.91
199-131001-0027,THE PEOPLE BY THROWING THEMSELVES INTO EITHER SCALE WILL INFALLIBLY MAKE IT PREPONDERATE IF THEIR RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY EITHER,7.8
199-131001-0028,WHICH CAN NEVER BE TOO HIGHLY PRIZED IT MAY SAFELY BE RECEIVED AS AN AXIOM IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENTS WILL IN ALL POSSIBLE CONTINGENCIES AFFORD COMPLETE SECURITY AGAINST INVASIONS OF THE PUBLIC LIBERTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY,16.705
199-131001-0029,PROJECTS OF USURPATION CANNOT BE MASKED UNDER PRETENSES SO LIKELY TO ESCAPE THE PENETRATION OF SELECT BODIES OF MEN AS OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE THE LEGISLATURES WILL HAVE BETTER MEANS OF INFORMATION THEY CAN DISCOVER THE DANGER AT A DISTANCE,14.945
199-131001-0030,AND THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE THEY CAN AT ONCE ADOPT A REGULAR PLAN OF OPPOSITION IN WHICH THEY CAN COMBINE ALL THE RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY THEY CAN READILY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER IN THE DIFFERENT STATES AND UNITE THEIR COMMON FORCES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THEIR COMMON LIBERTY,15.18
199-131001-0031,THE GREAT EXTENT OF THE COUNTRY IS A FURTHER SECURITY WE HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED ITS UTILITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF A FOREIGN POWER AND IT WOULD HAVE PRECISELY THE SAME EFFECT AGAINST THE ENTERPRISES OF AMBITIOUS RULERS IN THE NATIONAL COUNCILS,14.66
199-131001-0032,IF THE FEDERAL ARMY SHOULD BE ABLE TO QUELL THE RESISTANCE OF ONE STATE THE DISTANT STATES WOULD HAVE IT IN THEIR POWER TO MAKE HEAD WITH FRESH FORCES THE ADVANTAGES OBTAINED IN ONE PLACE MUST BE ABANDONED TO SUBDUE THE OPPOSITION IN OTHERS,13.69
199-131001-0033,AND THE MOMENT THE PART WHICH HAD BEEN REDUCED TO SUBMISSION WAS LEFT TO ITSELF ITS EFFORTS WOULD BE RENEWED AND ITS RESISTANCE REVIVE WE SHOULD RECOLLECT,9.75
199-131001-0034,THAT THE EXTENT OF THE MILITARY FORCE MUST AT ALL EVENTS BE REGULATED BY THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME TO COME IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN A LARGE ARMY,11.205
20-205-0000,IN SPITE OF UDOLPHO AND THE DRESSMAKER HOWEVER THE PARTY FROM PULTENEY STREET REACHED THE UPPER ROOMS IN VERY GOOD TIME THE THORPES AND JAMES MORLAND WERE THERE ONLY TWO MINUTES BEFORE THEM,11.85
20-205-0001,AND ISABELLA HAVING GONE THROUGH THE USUAL CEREMONIAL OF MEETING HER FRIEND WITH THE MOST SMILING AND AFFECTIONATE HASTE OF ADMIRING THE SET OF HER GOWN AND ENVYING THE CURL OF HER HAIR THEY FOLLOWED THEIR CHAPERONES ARM IN ARM INTO THE BALLROOM,15.045
20-205-0002,AND SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF MANY IDEAS BY A SQUEEZE OF THE HAND OR A SMILE OF AFFECTION THE DANCING BEGAN WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY WERE SEATED AND JAMES WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED QUITE AS LONG AS HIS SISTER,14.71
20-205-0003,WAS VERY IMPORTUNATE WITH ISABELLA TO STAND UP BUT JOHN WAS GONE INTO THE CARD ROOM TO SPEAK TO A FRIEND AND NOTHING SHE DECLARED,8.125
20-205-0004,I ASSURE YOU SAID SHE I WOULD NOT STAND UP WITHOUT YOUR DEAR SISTER FOR ALL THE WORLD FOR IF I DID WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE SEPARATED THE WHOLE EVENING CATHERINE ACCEPTED THIS KINDNESS WITH GRATITUDE,13.985
20-205-0005,AND THEY CONTINUED AS THEY WERE FOR THREE MINUTES LONGER WHEN ISABELLA WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO JAMES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER TURNED AGAIN TO HIS SISTER AND WHISPERED MY DEAR CREATURE I AM AFRAID I MUST LEAVE YOU YOUR BROTHER IS SO AMAZINGLY IMPATIENT TO BEGIN,14.77
20-205-0006,I KNOW YOU WILL NOT MIND MY GOING AWAY AND I DARE SAY JOHN WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT AND THEN YOU MAY EASILY FIND ME OUT CATHERINE THOUGH A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,12.375
20-205-0007,HAD TOO MUCH GOOD NATURE TO MAKE ANY OPPOSITION AND THE OTHERS RISING UP ISABELLA HAD ONLY TIME TO PRESS HER FRIEND'S HAND AND SAY GOOD BYE MY DEAR LOVE BEFORE THEY HURRIED OFF,11.1
20-205-0008,THE YOUNGER MISS THORPES BEING ALSO DANCING CATHERINE WAS LEFT TO THE MERCY OF MISSUS THORPE AND MISSUS ALLEN BETWEEN WHOM SHE NOW REMAINED,9.0
20-205-0009,SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING VEXED AT THE NON APPEARANCE OF MISTER THORPE FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED TO BE DANCING BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN,11.685
20-205-0010,SHE WAS SHARING WITH THE SCORES OF OTHER YOUNG LADIES STILL SITTING DOWN ALL THE DISCREDIT OF WANTING A PARTNER TO BE DISGRACED IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD TO WEAR THE APPEARANCE OF INFAMY WHILE HER HEART IS ALL PURITY,14.97
20-205-0011,CATHERINE HAD FORTITUDE TOO SHE SUFFERED BUT NO MURMUR PASSED HER LIPS FROM THIS STATE OF HUMILIATION SHE WAS ROUSED AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES,14.68
20-205-0012,TO A PLEASANTER FEELING BY SEEING NOT MISTER THORPE BUT MISTER TILNEY WITHIN THREE YARDS OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY SAT HE SEEMED TO BE MOVING THAT WAY BUT HE DID NOT SEE HER AND THEREFORE THE SMILE AND THE BLUSH,13.43
20-205-0013,AND WHOM CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY GUESSED TO BE HIS SISTER THUS UNTHINKINGLY THROWING AWAY A FAIR OPPORTUNITY OF CONSIDERING HIM LOST TO HER FOREVER BY BEING MARRIED ALREADY BUT GUIDED ONLY BY WHAT WAS SIMPLE AND PROBABLE,13.535
20-205-0014,HE HAD NOT BEHAVED HE HAD NOT TALKED LIKE THE MARRIED MEN TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN USED HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED A WIFE AND HE HAD ACKNOWLEDGED A SISTER FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SPRANG THE INSTANT CONCLUSION OF HIS SISTER'S NOW BEING BY HIS SIDE,15.915
20-205-0015,ON MISSUS ALLEN'S BOSOM CATHERINE SAT ERECT IN THE PERFECT USE OF HER SENSES AND WITH CHEEKS ONLY A LITTLE REDDER THAN USUAL MISTER TILNEY AND HIS COMPANION WHO CONTINUED THOUGH SLOWLY TO APPROACH,14.855
20-205-0016,WERE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY A LADY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS THORPE,4.79
20-205-0017,AND CATHERINE CATCHING MISTER TILNEY'S EYE INSTANTLY RECEIVED FROM HIM THE SMILING TRIBUTE OF RECOGNITION SHE RETURNED IT WITH PLEASURE AND THEN ADVANCING STILL NEARER HE SPOKE BOTH TO HER AND MISSUS ALLEN,13.535
20-205-0018,BY WHOM HE WAS VERY CIVILLY ACKNOWLEDGED I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN SIR INDEED I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD LEFT BATH HE THANKED HER FOR HER FEARS,12.36
20-205-0019,ON THE VERY MORNING AFTER HIS HAVING HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER WELL SIR AND I DARE SAY YOU ARE NOT SORRY TO BE BACK AGAIN FOR IT IS JUST THE PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND INDEED FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TOO,12.605
20-205-0020,I TELL MISTER ALLEN WHEN HE TALKS OF BEING SICK OF IT THAT I AM SURE HE SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN FOR IT IS SO VERY AGREEABLE A PLACE THAT IT IS MUCH BETTER TO BE HERE THAN AT HOME AT THIS DULL TIME OF YEAR,12.26
20-205-0021,I TELL HIM HE IS QUITE IN LUCK TO BE SENT HERE FOR HIS HEALTH AND I HOPE MADAM THAT MISTER ALLEN WILL BE OBLIGED TO LIKE THE PLACE FROM FINDING IT OF SERVICE TO HIM THANK YOU SIR I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL,14.05
20-205-0022,A NEIGHBOUR OF OURS DOCTOR SKINNER WAS HERE FOR HIS HEALTH LAST WINTER AND CAME AWAY QUITE STOUT,6.7
20-205-0023,YES SIR AND DOCTOR SKINNER AND HIS FAMILY WERE HERE THREE MONTHS SO I TELL MISTER ALLEN HE MUST NOT BE IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY,7.97
20-205-0024,AS THEY HAD AGREED TO JOIN THEIR PARTY THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE MISTER TILNEY STILL CONTINUING STANDING BEFORE THEM AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES CONSIDERATION HE ASKED CATHERINE TO DANCE WITH HIM THIS COMPLIMENT DELIGHTFUL AS IT WAS,14.565
20-205-0025,PRODUCED SEVERE MORTIFICATION TO THE LADY AND IN GIVING HER DENIAL SHE EXPRESSED HER SORROW ON THE OCCASION SO VERY MUCH AS IF SHE REALLY FELT IT THAT HAD THORPE WHO JOINED HER JUST AFTERWARDS BEEN HALF A MINUTE EARLIER,14.565
20-205-0026,HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HER SUFFERINGS RATHER TOO ACUTE THE VERY EASY MANNER IN WHICH HE THEN TOLD HER THAT HE HAD KEPT HER WAITING DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RECONCILE HER MORE TO HER LOT NOR DID THE PARTICULARS WHICH HE ENTERED INTO WHILE THEY WERE STANDING UP,15.995
20-205-0027,OF THE HORSES AND DOGS OF THE FRIEND WHOM HE HAD JUST LEFT AND OF A PROPOSED EXCHANGE OF TERRIERS BETWEEN THEM INTEREST HER SO MUCH AS TO PREVENT HER LOOKING VERY OFTEN TOWARDS THAT PART OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE HAD LEFT MISTER TILNEY,15.04
20-205-0028,OF HER DEAR ISABELLA TO WHOM SHE PARTICULARLY LONGED TO POINT OUT THAT GENTLEMAN SHE COULD SEE NOTHING THEY WERE IN DIFFERENT SETS SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM ALL HER PARTY AND AWAY FROM ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE ONE MORTIFICATION SUCCEEDED ANOTHER,14.71
20-205-0029,AND FROM THE WHOLE SHE DEDUCED THIS USEFUL LESSON THAT TO GO PREVIOUSLY ENGAGED TO A BALL DOES NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE EITHER THE DIGNITY OR ENJOYMENT OF A YOUNG LADY,10.54
20-205-0030,AND TURNING ROUND PERCEIVED MISSUS HUGHES DIRECTLY BEHIND HER ATTENDED BY MISS TILNEY AND A GENTLEMAN I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS MORLAND SAID SHE FOR THIS LIBERTY BUT I CANNOT ANYHOW GET TO MISS THORPE,13.75
20-205-0031,MISSUS HUGHES COULD NOT HAVE APPLIED TO ANY CREATURE IN THE ROOM MORE HAPPY TO OBLIGE HER THAN CATHERINE,6.09
20-205-0032,MISS TILNEY EXPRESSING A PROPER SENSE OF SUCH GOODNESS MISS MORLAND WITH THE REAL DELICACY OF A GENEROUS MIND MAKING LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION,8.2649375
20-205-0033,MISS TILNEY HAD A GOOD FIGURE A PRETTY FACE AND A VERY AGREEABLE COUNTENANCE AND HER AIR THOUGH IT HAD NOT ALL THE DECIDED PRETENSION THE RESOLUTE STYLISHNESS OF MISS THORPE'S HAD MORE REAL ELEGANCE,14.66
20-205-0034,AND WITHOUT EXAGGERATED FEELINGS OF ECSTATIC DELIGHT OR INCONCEIVABLE VEXATION ON EVERY LITTLE TRIFLING OCCURRENCE CATHERINE INTERESTED AT ONCE BY HER APPEARANCE AND HER RELATIONSHIP TO MISTER TILNEY,14.195
20-205-0035,PREVENTED THEIR DOING MORE THAN GOING THROUGH THE FIRST RUDIMENTS OF AN ACQUAINTANCE BY INFORMING THEMSELVES HOW WELL THE OTHER LIKED BATH HOW MUCH SHE ADMIRED ITS BUILDINGS AND SURROUNDING COUNTRY WHETHER SHE DREW OR PLAYED OR SANG,14.93
20-205-0036,AND WHETHER SHE WAS FOND OF RIDING ON HORSEBACK THE TWO DANCES WERE SCARCELY CONCLUDED BEFORE CATHERINE FOUND HER ARM GENTLY SEIZED BY HER FAITHFUL ISABELLA WHO IN GREAT SPIRITS EXCLAIMED AT LAST I HAVE GOT YOU,14.255
20-205-0037,MY DEAREST CREATURE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU THIS HOUR WHAT COULD INDUCE YOU TO COME INTO THIS SET,6.485

20-205-0040,WHISPERED CATHERINE DETACHING HER FRIEND FROM JAMES IT IS MISTER TILNEY'S SISTER,6.005
20-205-0041,LET ME LOOK AT HER THIS MOMENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL GIRL I NEVER SAW ANYTHING HALF SO BEAUTIFUL BUT WHERE IS HER ALL CONQUERING BROTHER IS HE IN THE ROOM,10.57
20-205-0042,I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE,15.245

20-205-0046,BUT SHE RESISTED I TELL YOU MISTER MORLAND SHE CRIED I WOULD NOT DO SUCH A THING FOR ALL THE WORLD,8.19
20-205-0047,UPON MY HONOUR SAID JAMES IN THESE PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES IT IS AS OFTEN DONE AS NOT NONSENSE HOW CAN YOU SAY SO BUT WHEN YOU MEN HAVE A POINT TO CARRY YOU NEVER STICK AT ANYTHING,14.25

20-205-0054,BUT SHE HAD NOT LOOKED ROUND LONG BEFORE SHE SAW HIM LEADING A YOUNG LADY TO THE DANCE AH HE HAS GOT A PARTNER I WISH HE HAD ASKED YOU SAID MISSUS ALLEN AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE SHE ADDED,13.995
20-205-0055,HE IS A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN INDEED HE IS MISSUS ALLEN SAID MISSUS THORPE SMILING COMPLACENTLY I MUST SAY IT THOUGH I AM HIS MOTHER THAT THERE IS NOT A MORE AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD,15.87
20-205-0056,THIS INAPPLICABLE ANSWER MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF MANY BUT IT DID NOT PUZZLE MISSUS ALLEN FOR AFTER ONLY A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION SHE SAID IN A WHISPER TO CATHERINE,11.95
20-205-0057,I DARE SAY SHE THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING OF HER SON CATHERINE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND VEXED SHE SEEMED TO HAVE MISSED BY SO LITTLE THE VERY OBJECT SHE HAD HAD IN VIEW,14.0
20-205-0058,AND THIS PERSUASION DID NOT INCLINE HER TO A VERY GRACIOUS REPLY WHEN JOHN THORPE CAME UP TO HER SOON AFTERWARDS AND SAID WELL MISS MORLAND I SUPPOSE YOU AND I ARE TO STAND UP AND JIG IT TOGETHER AGAIN OH NO I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU,15.95

20-5360-0001,THE EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER AND THE LIGHT OF THE CHANDELIER WHICH FELL ON ALL PRESENTED A PICTURE OF HOME PEACE THOUGH IT MAY NOT HAVE DESERVED THE NAME OF LUXURY WITHOUT,14.71
20-5360-0002,HEAVY FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING THICKLY FLAKES AS LARGE AND NEARLY AS HEAVY AS A CROWN PIECE RENDERING THE ATMOSPHERE SO DENSE AND OBSCURE THAT A MAN COULD NOT SEE A YARD BEFORE HIM MISTER CARLYLE HAD DRIVEN HOME IN THE PONY CARRIAGE,15.555
20-5360-0003,AND THE SNOW HAD SO SETTLED UPON HIM THAT LUCY WHO HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HALL SCREAMED OUT LAUGHINGLY,7.215

20-5360-0055,DROP UPON YOU THERE WAS A LITTLE PARTITION IN THE WINDOW CURTAIN IT HAD NOT BEEN DRAWN CLOSE AND THROUGH IT I COULD SEE YOU AND MISS CARLYLE I SAW HER LEAVE THE ROOM I SAW YOU COME TO THE WINDOW AND OPEN IT AND THEN I SPOKE,16.085

20-5360-0057,BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS SPOKEN THE ROOM DOOR WAS TRIED AND THEN GENTLY KNOCKED AT MISTER CARLYLE PLACED HIS HAND ON RICHARD WHO WAS LOOKING SCARED OUT OF HIS WITS,12.08
20-5360-0058,NO ONE SHALL COME IN IT IS ONLY PETER NOT PETER'S VOICE HOWEVER BUT JOYCE'S WAS HEARD IN RESPONSE TO MISTER CARLYLE'S DEMAND OF WHO WAS THERE,11.445
20-5360-0059,MISS CARLYLE HAS LEFT HER HANDKERCHIEF DOWNSTAIRS SIR AND HAS SENT ME FOR IT YOU CANNOT COME IN I AM BUSY WAS THE ANSWER DELIVERED IN A CLEAR AND MOST DECISIVE TONE,13.33
20-5360-0060,WHO WAS IT QUIVERED RICHARD AS JOYCE WAS HEARD GOING AWAY IT WAS JOYCE WHAT IS SHE HERE STILL,10.355
20-5360-0061,AFY WAS HERE HERSELF TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO WAS SHE THOUGH UTTERED RICHARD BEGUILED FOR AN INSTANT FROM THE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN DANGER WHAT IS SHE DOING SHE IS IN SERVICE AS A LADY'S MAID,15.655
20-5360-0062,RICHARD I QUESTIONED AFY ABOUT THORN SHE PROTESTED SOLEMNLY TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT THORN WHO COMMITTED THE DEED THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HE FOR THORN WAS WITH HER AT THE MOMENT OF ITS BEING DONE IT'S NOT TRUE,15.7
20-5360-0063,FIRED RICHARD IT WAS THORN RICHARD YOU CANNOT TELL,6.035
20-5360-0064,I KNOW THAT NO MAN COULD HAVE RUSHED OUT IN THAT FRANTIC MANNER WITH THOSE SIGNS OF GUILT AND FEAR ABOUT HIM UNLESS HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A BAD DEED WAS RICHARD HARE'S ANSWER IT COULD HAVE BEEN NO ONE ELSE,14.31
20-5360-0065,AFY DECLARED HE WAS WITH HER REPEATED MISTER CARLYLE LOOK HERE SIR YOU ARE A SHARP MAN AND FOLKS SAY I AM NOT BUT I CAN SEE THINGS AND DRAW MY REASONING AS WELL AS THEY CAN PERHAPS,13.985
20-5360-0066,IF THORN WERE NOT HALLIJOHN'S MURDERER WHY SHOULD HE BE PERSECUTING ME WHAT WOULD HE CARE ABOUT ME AND WHY SHOULD HIS FACE TURN LIVID AS IT HAS DONE EACH TIME HE HAS SEEN MY EYES UPON HIM,13.725
20-5360-0067,WHETHER HE DID COMMIT THE MURDER OR WHETHER HE DIDN'T HE MUST KNOW THAT I DID NOT BECAUSE HE CAME UPON ME WAITING AS HE WAS TEARING FROM THE COTTAGE DICK'S REASONING WAS NOT BAD ANOTHER THING HE RESUMED,15.98
20-5360-0068,THAT SHE WAS ALONE AT THE BACK OF THE COTTAGE AND KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT TILL AFTERWARDS HOW COULD SHE HAVE SWORN SHE WAS ALONE IF THORN WAS WITH HER THE FACT HAD ENTIRELY ESCAPED MISTER CARLYLE'S MEMORY IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH AFY,15.8699375
20-5360-0069,OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO POINT OUT THE DISCREPANCY AND TO INQUIRE HOW SHE COULD RECONCILE IT YET HER ASSERTION TO HIM HAD BEEN MOST POSITIVE AND SOLEMN THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE MATTER WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE,15.6350625
20-5360-0070,NOW THAT I HAVE GOT OVER MY PASSION FOR AFY I CAN SEE HER FAULTS MISTER CARLYLE SHE'D NO MORE TELL AN UNTRUTH THAN I SHOULD STICK A MOST AWFUL THUNDERING AT THE ROOM DOOR,13.215
20-5360-0071,LOUD ENOUGH TO BRING THE VERY HOUSE DOWN NO OFFICERS OF JUSTICE SEARCHING FOR A FUGITIVE EVER MADE A LOUDER RICHARD HARE HIS FACE TURNED TO CHALK HIS EYES STARTING,13.57
20-5360-0072,AND HIS OWN LIGHT HAIR BRISTLING UP WITH HORROR STRUGGLED INTO HIS WET SMOCK FROCK AFTER A FASHION THE TAILS UP ABOUT HIS EARS AND THE SLEEVES HANGING FORCED ON HIS HAT AND HIS FALSE WHISKERS LOOKED ROUND IN A BEWILDERED MANNER,15.3
20-5360-0073,FOR SOME CUPBOARD OR MOUSE HOLE INTO WHICH HE MIGHT CREEP AND SEEING NONE RUSHED TO THE FIREPLACE AND PLACED HIS FOOT ON THE FENDER THAT HE PURPOSED AN ATTEMPT AT CHIMNEY CLIMBING WAS EVIDENT THOUGH HOW THE FIRE WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH HIS PANTALOONS,15.765
20-5360-0074,NOT TO SPEAK OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED POOR DICK APPEARED COMPLETELY TO IGNORE MISTER CARLYLE DREW HIM BACK KEEPING HIS CALM POWERFUL HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER WHILE CERTAIN SOUNDS IN AN ANGRY VOICE WERE JERKED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE,14.84
20-5360-0075,RICHARD BE A MAN PUT ASIDE THIS WEAKNESS THIS FEAR HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU THAT HARM SHALL NOT COME NEAR YOU IN MY HOUSE IT MAY BE THAT OFFICER FROM LONDON,11.97

20-5360-0078,NO THAT I CAN'T IF SHE HAS A MIND TO COME IN WAS THE CANDID ANSWER YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE WAS RICHARD SHE IS NOT ALTERED KNOWING THAT TO SPEAK ON THIS SIDE THE DOOR TO HIS SISTER,14.72
20-5360-0079,WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER RESOLUTE MOODS WOULD BE OF NO USE MISTER CARLYLE OPENED THE DOOR DEXTEROUSLY SWUNG HIMSELF THROUGH IT AND SHUT IT AFTER HIM,9.47

202-122857-0018,IT'S SO NICE TO BE APPRECIATED SIGHED ANNE RAPTUROUSLY TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT THE GIRLS WERE NOT THE ONLY SCHOLARS WHO APPRECIATED HER WHEN ANNE WENT TO HER SEAT AFTER DINNER HOUR,13.115
202-122857-0019,SHE HAD BEEN TOLD BY MISTER PHILLIPS TO SIT WITH THE MODEL MINNIE ANDREWS SHE FOUND ON HER DESK A BIG LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRY APPLE ANNE CAUGHT IT UP ALL READY TO TAKE A BITE WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE ONLY PLACE IN AVONLEA WHERE STRAWBERRY APPLES GREW,15.21
202-122857-0020,WAS IN THE OLD BLYTHE ORCHARD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE OF SHINING WATERS ANNE DROPPED THE APPLE AS IF IT WERE A RED HOT COAL AND OSTENTATIOUSLY WIPED HER FINGERS ON HER HANDKERCHIEF,13.155
202-122857-0021,BEDIZENED WITH STRIPED RED AND YELLOW PAPER COSTING TWO CENTS WHERE ORDINARY PENCILS COST ONLY ONE WHICH HE SENT UP TO HER AFTER DINNER HOUR MET WITH A MORE FAVORABLE RECEPTION ANNE WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO ACCEPT IT,15.825
202-122857-0022,AND REWARDED THE DONOR WITH A SMILE WHICH EXALTED THAT INFATUATED YOUTH STRAIGHTWAY INTO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN OF DELIGHT AND CAUSED HIM TO MAKE SUCH FEARFUL ERRORS IN HIS DICTATION THAT MISTER PHILLIPS KEPT HIM IN AFTER SCHOOL TO REWRITE IT,14.865
202-122857-0023,BUT AS THE CAESAR'S PAGEANT SHORN OF BRUTUS BUST DID BUT OF ROME'S BEST SON REMIND HER MORE SO THE MARKED ABSENCE OF ANY TRIBUTE OR RECOGNITION FROM DIANA BARRY WHO WAS SITTING WITH GERTIE PYE EMBITTERED,15.08
202-122857-0024,ANNE'S LITTLE TRIUMPH DIANA MIGHT JUST HAVE SMILED AT ME ONCE I THINK SHE MOURNED TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT BUT THE NEXT MORNING A NOTE MOST FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY TWISTED AND FOLDED,13.73

202-122857-0030,MARILLA PESSIMISTICALLY EXPECTED MORE TROUBLE SINCE ANNE HAD AGAIN BEGUN TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT NONE DEVELOPED PERHAPS ANNE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF THE MODEL SPIRIT FROM MINNIE ANDREWS,12.635
202-122857-0031,AT LEAST SHE GOT ON VERY WELL WITH MISTER PHILLIPS THENCEFORTH SHE FLUNG HERSELF INTO HER STUDIES HEART AND SOUL DETERMINED NOT TO BE OUTDONE IN ANY CLASS BY GILBERT BLYTHE THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM WAS SOON APPARENT,14.315
202-122857-0032,IT WAS ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED ON GILBERT'S SIDE BUT IT IS MUCH TO BE FEARED THAT THE SAME THING CANNOT BE SAID OF ANNE WHO HAD CERTAINLY AN UNPRAISEWORTHY TENACITY FOR HOLDING GRUDGES SHE WAS AS INTENSE IN HER HATREDS AS IN HER LOVES,15.085
202-122857-0033,SHE WOULD NOT STOOP TO ADMIT THAT SHE MEANT TO RIVAL GILBERT IN SCHOOLWORK BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS EXISTENCE WHICH ANNE PERSISTENTLY IGNORED BUT THE RIVALRY WAS THERE AND HONORS FLUCTUATED BETWEEN THEM,14.38
202-122857-0034,NOW GILBERT WAS HEAD OF THE SPELLING CLASS NOW ANNE WITH A TOSS OF HER LONG RED BRAIDS SPELLED HIM DOWN ONE MORNING GILBERT HAD ALL HIS SUMS DONE CORRECTLY AND HAD HIS NAME WRITTEN ON THE BLACKBOARD ON THE ROLL OF HONOR,15.005
202-122857-0035,THE NEXT MORNING ANNE HAVING WRESTLED WILDLY WITH DECIMALS THE ENTIRE EVENING BEFORE WOULD BE FIRST ONE AWFUL DAY THEY WERE TIES AND THEIR NAMES WERE WRITTEN UP TOGETHER IT WAS ALMOST AS BAD AS A TAKE NOTICE,15.725
202-122857-0036,AND ANNE'S MORTIFICATION WAS AS EVIDENT AS GILBERT'S SATISFACTION WHEN THE WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS AT THE END OF EACH MONTH WERE HELD THE SUSPENSE WAS TERRIBLE THE FIRST MONTH GILBERT CAME OUT THREE MARKS AHEAD THE SECOND,14.83
202-122857-0037,ANNE BEAT HIM BY FIVE BUT HER TRIUMPH WAS MARRED BY THE FACT THAT GILBERT CONGRATULATED HER HEARTILY BEFORE THE WHOLE SCHOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO MUCH SWEETER TO HER IF HE HAD FELT THE STING OF HIS DEFEAT,13.095
202-122857-0038,MISTER PHILLIPS MIGHT NOT BE A VERY GOOD TEACHER BUT A PUPIL SO INFLEXIBLY DETERMINED ON LEARNING AS ANNE WAS COULD HARDLY ESCAPE MAKING PROGRESS UNDER ANY KIND OF TEACHER,11.17
202-122857-0039,ANNE AND GILBERT WERE BOTH PROMOTED INTO THE FIFTH CLASS AND ALLOWED TO BEGIN STUDYING THE ELEMENTS OF THE BRANCHES BY WHICH LATIN GEOMETRY FRENCH AND ALGEBRA WERE MEANT IN GEOMETRY ANNE MET HER WATERLOO,14.655
202-122857-0040,IT'S PERFECTLY AWFUL STUFF MARILLA SHE GROANED I'M SURE I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION IN IT AT ALL MISTER PHILLIPS SAYS I'M THE WORST DUNCE HE EVER SAW AT IT,16.345
202-122857-0041,EVEN DIANA GETS ALONG BETTER THAN I DO BUT I DON'T MIND BEING BEATEN BY DIANA,5.545

215-122798-0012,AND THAT WAS A SAD AFFAIR WHEN PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR GLASSES TO SEE WELL AND RIGHTLY THEN THE WICKED SPRITE LAUGHED TILL HE ALMOST CHOKED FOR ALL THIS TICKLED HIS FANCY THE FINE SPLINTERS STILL FLEW ABOUT IN THE AIR,14.05
215-122798-0013,AND NOW WE SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SECOND STORY A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL IN A LARGE TOWN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY HOUSES AND SO MANY PEOPLE,13.015
215-122798-0014,THAT THERE IS NO ROOF LEFT FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN AND WHERE ON THIS ACCOUNT MOST PERSONS ARE OBLIGED TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS IN POTS THERE LIVED TWO LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAD A GARDEN SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A FLOWER POT,14.235
215-122798-0015,THEY WERE NOT BROTHER AND SISTER BUT THEY CARED FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS IF THEY WERE THEIR PARENTS LIVED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THEY INHABITED TWO GARRETS AND WHERE THE ROOF OF THE ONE HOUSE JOINED THAT OF THE OTHER,14.15
215-122798-0016,AND THE GUTTER RAN ALONG THE EXTREME END OF IT THERE WAS TO EACH HOUSE A SMALL WINDOW ONE NEEDED ONLY TO STEP OVER THE GUTTER TO GET FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS HAD LARGE WOODEN BOXES THERE,13.515
215-122798-0017,AND LITTLE ROSETREES BESIDES THERE WAS A ROSE IN EACH BOX AND THEY GREW SPLENDIDLY THEY NOW THOUGHT OF PLACING THE BOXES ACROSS THE GUTTER SO THAT THEY NEARLY REACHED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER AND LOOKED JUST LIKE TWO WALLS OF FLOWERS,15.675
215-122798-0018,THE TENDRILS OF THE PEAS HUNG DOWN OVER THE BOXES AND THE ROSE TREES SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES TWINED ROUND THE WINDOWS AND THEN BENT TOWARDS EACH OTHER IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TRIUMPHANT ARCH OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS,14.535
215-122798-0019,THE BOXES WERE VERY HIGH AND THE CHILDREN KNEW THAT THEY MUST NOT CREEP OVER THEM SO THEY OFTEN OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GET OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO EACH OTHER AND TO SIT ON THEIR LITTLE STOOLS AMONG THE ROSES WHERE THEY COULD PLAY DELIGHTFULLY,14.37
215-122798-0020,THERE WAS AN END OF THIS PLEASURE THE WINDOWS WERE OFTEN FROZEN OVER BUT THEN THEY HEATED COPPER FARTHINGS ON THE STOVE AND LAID THE HOT FARTHING ON THE WINDOWPANE AND THEN THEY HAD A CAPITAL PEEP HOLE QUITE NICELY ROUNDED,15.19
215-122798-0021,AND OUT OF EACH PEEPED A GENTLE FRIENDLY EYE IT WAS THE LITTLE BOY,4.275
215-122798-0022,HIS NAME WAS KAY HERS WAS GERDA IN SUMMER WITH ONE JUMP THEY COULD GET TO EACH OTHER BUT IN WINTER THEY WERE OBLIGED FIRST TO GO DOWN THE LONG STAIRS AND THEN UP THE LONG STAIRS AGAIN,13.07
215-122798-0023,AND OUT OF DOORS THERE WAS QUITE A SNOW STORM IT IS THE WHITE BEES THAT ARE SWARMING SAID KAY'S OLD GRANDMOTHER,7.65
215-122798-0024,ASKED THE LITTLE BOY FOR HE KNEW THAT THE HONEY BEES ALWAYS HAVE ONE,3.935
215-122798-0025,SAID THE GRANDMOTHER SHE FLIES WHERE THE SWARM HANGS IN THE THICKEST CLUSTERS SHE IS THE LARGEST OF ALL AND SHE CAN NEVER REMAIN QUIETLY ON THE EARTH BUT GOES UP AGAIN INTO THE BLACK CLOUDS,13.84
215-122798-0026,MANY A WINTER'S NIGHT SHE FLIES THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE TOWN AND PEEPS IN AT THE WINDOWS,6.65
215-122798-0027,SAID BOTH THE CHILDREN AND SO THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE CAN THE SNOW QUEEN COME IN,6.02
215-122798-0028,AND THEN HIS GRANDMOTHER PATTED HIS HEAD AND TOLD HIM OTHER STORIES IN THE EVENING WHEN LITTLE KAY WAS AT HOME AND HALF UNDRESSED HE CLIMBED UP ON THE CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND PEEPED OUT OF THE LITTLE HOLE A FEW SNOW FLAKES WERE FALLING,15.65
215-122798-0029,AND ONE THE LARGEST OF ALL REMAINED LYING ON THE EDGE OF A FLOWER POT THE FLAKE OF SNOW GREW LARGER AND LARGER,8.05
215-122798-0030,DRESSED IN THE FINEST WHITE GAUZE MADE OF A MILLION LITTLE FLAKES LIKE STARS SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL,7.515
215-122798-0031,YET SHE LIVED HER EYES GAZED FIXEDLY LIKE TWO STARS BUT THERE WAS NEITHER QUIET NOR REPOSE IN THEM SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND BECKONED WITH HER HAND THE LITTLE BOY WAS FRIGHTENED,13.895
215-122798-0032,THE NEXT DAY IT WAS A SHARP FROST AND THEN THE SPRING CAME THE SUN SHONE THE GREEN LEAVES APPEARED THE SWALLOWS BUILT THEIR NESTS THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN AGAIN SAT IN THEIR PRETTY GARDEN,14.24
215-122798-0033,THAT SUMMER THE ROSES FLOWERED IN UNWONTED BEAUTY THE LITTLE GIRL HAD LEARNED A HYMN,5.785
215-122798-0034,AND THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER OWN FLOWERS AND SHE SANG THE VERSE TO THE LITTLE BOY WHO THEN SANG IT WITH HER THE ROSE IN THE VALLEY IS BLOOMING SO SWEET,9.45
215-122798-0035,AND THE CHILDREN HELD EACH OTHER BY THE HAND KISSED THE ROSES LOOKED UP AT THE CLEAR SUNSHINE AND SPOKE AS THOUGH THEY REALLY SAW ANGELS THERE WHAT LOVELY SUMMER DAYS THOSE WERE HOW DELIGHTFUL TO BE OUT IN THE AIR NEAR THE FRESH ROSE BUSHES,15.35
215-122798-0036,KAY AND GERDA LOOKED AT THE PICTURE BOOK FULL OF BEASTS AND OF BIRDS AND IT WAS THEN THE CLOCK IN THE CHURCH TOWER WAS JUST STRIKING FIVE THAT KAY SAID OH,10.935
215-122798-0037,THE LITTLE GIRL PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK HE WINKED HIS EYES NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN,6.905
215-122798-0038,SAID HE BUT IT WAS NOT IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF GLASS FROM THE MAGIC MIRROR,5.57
215-122798-0039,AND POOR KAY HAD GOT ANOTHER PIECE RIGHT IN HIS HEART,3.205
215-122798-0040,THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE BOX THEY ARE PLANTED IN AND THEN HE GAVE THE BOX A GOOD KICK WITH HIS FOOT,5.38
215-122798-0041,AND AS HE PERCEIVED HER FRIGHT HE PULLED UP ANOTHER ROSE GOT IN AT THE WINDOW AND HASTENED OFF FROM DEAR LITTLE GERDA AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE BROUGHT HER PICTURE BOOK HE ASKED WHAT HORRID BEASTS HAVE YOU THERE,13.78
215-122798-0042,AND IF HIS GRANDMOTHER TOLD THEM STORIES HE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED HER BESIDES IF HE COULD MANAGE IT HE WOULD GET BEHIND HER,7.74
215-122798-0043,HE COPIED ALL HER WAYS AND THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM HE WAS SOON ABLE TO IMITATE THE GAIT AND MANNER OF EVERYONE IN THE STREET EVERYTHING THAT WAS PECULIAR AND DISPLEASING IN THEM THAT KAY KNEW HOW TO IMITATE AND AT SUCH TIMES,14.655
215-122798-0044,THE BOY IS CERTAINLY VERY CLEVER,2.73
215-122798-0045,THE GLASS THAT WAS STICKING IN HIS HEART WHICH MADE HIM TEASE EVEN LITTLE GERDA WHOSE WHOLE SOUL WAS DEVOTED TO HIM HIS GAMES NOW WERE QUITE DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN THEY WERE SO VERY KNOWING ONE WINTER'S DAY WHEN THE FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FLYING ABOUT,16.185

228-121761-0000,CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR FAILURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN NOW ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE CLOUDS HAD CLEARED OFF AND THE NIGHT HAD CHANGED FROM BROWN AND GREY,14.385
228-121761-0001,TO BLUE SPARKLING WITH GOLD I COULD SEE MUCH BETTER AND FANCIED I COULD HEAR BETTER TOO,8.395
228-121761-0002,I HAD NOT RIDDEN FAR FROM THE STABLE BEFORE I AGAIN FOUND MYSELF,5.49
228-121761-0003,WITH ONLY THE WIDE SILENT FIELDS ABOUT ME AND THE WIDER AND MORE SILENT SKY OVER MY HEAD THE FEAR BEGAN TO RETURN I FANCIED SOMETHING STRANGE CREEPING ALONG EVERY DITCH,16.34
228-121761-0004,SOMETHING SHAPELESS BUT WITH A TERRIBLE CRY IN IT NEXT I THOUGHT I SAW A SCARCELY VISIBLE FORM NOW LIKE A CREATURE ON ALL FOURS NOW LIKE A MAN FAR OFF,14.635
228-121761-0005,BUT COMING RAPIDLY TOWARDS ME ACROSS THE NEAREST FIELD IT ALWAYS VANISHED HOWEVER BEFORE IT CAME CLOSE THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THE FASTER I RODE THE MORE FRIGHTENED I BECAME,15.745
228-121761-0006,FOR MY SPEED SEEMED TO DRAW THE TERRORS THE FASTER AFTER ME HAVING DISCOVERED THIS I CHANGED MY PLAN AND WHEN I FELT MORE FRIGHTENED DREW REIN AND WENT SLOWER,13.955
228-121761-0007,AND CERTAINLY AS OFTEN AS I DID SO IT ABATED FEAR IS A WORSE THING THAN DANGER I HAD TO PASS VERY NIGH THE POOL TO WHICH TURKEY AND I HAD GONE THE NIGHT OF OUR ADVENTURE WITH BOGBONNY'S BULL,14.98
228-121761-0008,THAT STORY WAS NOW FAR OFF IN THE PAST,3.455
228-121761-0009,NOTWITHSTANDING IN FACT I OWED THE GREATER PART OF THE COURAGE I POSSESSED,5.855
228-121761-0010,I DARED NOT HAVE GONE ON MY OWN TWO LEGS IT WAS NOT THAT I COULD SO EASILY RUN AWAY WITH FOUR INSTEAD BUT THAT SOMEHOW I WAS LIFTED ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL OF FEAR BY BEING UPON HER BACK,14.725
228-121761-0011,AT LENGTH I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE KEEPER'S FARM AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE MOON PEEPED FROM BEHIND A HILL THROWING AS LONG SHADOWS AS THE SETTING SUN BUT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION,13.65
228-121761-0012,THE SHADOWS WERE VERY DIFFERENT TOO SOMEHOW THEY WERE LIKER TO THE LIGHT THAT MADE THEM THAN THE SUN SHADOWS ARE TO THE SUNLIGHT BOTH THE LIGHT AND THE SHADOWS OF THE MOON WERE STRANGE AND FEARFUL TO ME,14.65
228-121761-0013,ARE ALL SO STRONG AND SO REAL AND SO FRIENDLY YOU SEEM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM THEY BELONG TO YOUR HOUSE,7.68
228-121761-0014,BUT WITH THE MOON AND ITS SHADOWS IT IS VERY DIFFERENT INDEED THE FACT IS THE MOON IS TRYING TO DO WHAT SHE CANNOT DO,10.64
228-121761-0015,SHE IS NOT ABLE FOR THIS FOR HER LIGHT IS NOT HER OWN IT IS SECOND HAND FROM THE SUN HIMSELF AND HER SHADOWS THEREFORE ALSO ARE SECOND HAND SHADOWS PIECES CUT OUT OF THE GREAT SUN SHADOW,14.93
228-121761-0016,AND COLOURED A LITTLE WITH THE MOON'S YELLOWNESS IF I WERE WRITING FOR GROWN PEOPLE I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THINGS BECAUSE THEY THINK ABOUT THEM AND ASK GOD TO TEACH THEM WALK IN THE SUNLIGHT,15.95
228-121761-0017,AND OTHERS WHO TAKE THINGS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TELL THEM SO ARE ALWAYS WALKING IN THE STRANGE MOONLIGHT,8.89
228-121761-0018,FOR THEY HARDLY KNOW LIGHT FROM DARKNESS WELL AT FIRST THE MOON FRIGHTENED ME A LITTLE SHE LOOKED SO KNOWING AND YET ALL SHE SAID ROUND ABOUT ME WAS SO STRANGE,14.82
228-121761-0019,BUT I RODE QUIETLY UP TO THE BACK OF THE YARD WHERE THE RICKS STOOD GOT OFF MISSY AND FASTENED THE BRIDLE TO THE GATE AND WALKED ACROSS TO THE CART SHED WHERE THE MOON WAS SHINING UPON THE LADDER LEADING UP TO THE LOFT,15.695
228-121761-0020,I CLIMBED THE LADDER AND AFTER SEVERAL FAILURES SUCCEEDED IN FINDING HOW THE DOOR WAS FASTENED WHEN I OPENED IT THE MOONLIGHT GOT IN BEFORE ME,12.025
228-121761-0021,WHERE JAMIE WAS LYING ASLEEP WITH A RUG OVER HIM I CROSSED THE FLOOR KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND TRIED TO WAKE HIM THIS WAS NOT SO EASY,12.545
228-121761-0022,HE WAS FAR TOO SOUND ASLEEP TO BE TROUBLED BY THE RATS FOR SLEEP IS AN ARMOUR YES A CASTLE AGAINST MANY ENEMIES I GOT HOLD OF ONE OF HIS HANDS,13.895
228-121761-0023,AND IN LIFTING IT TO PULL HIM UP FOUND A CORD TIED TO HIS WRIST I WAS INDIGNANT,6.835
228-121761-0024,I GAVE THE CORD A GREAT TUG OF ANGER PULLED OUT MY KNIFE AND CUT IT THEN HAULING JAMIE UP GOT HIM HALF AWAKE AT LAST HE STARED WITH FRIGHT FIRST AND THEN BEGAN TO CRY,15.665
228-121761-0025,AS SOON AS HE WAS AWAKE ENOUGH TO KNOW ME HE STOPPED CRYING BUT NOT STARING AND HIS EYES SEEMED TO HAVE NOTHING BETTER THAN MOONLIGHT IN THEM COME ALONG JAMIE I SAID I'M COME TO TAKE YOU HOME,15.585
228-121761-0026,I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME,2.67
228-121761-0027,THAT'S VERY UNGRATEFUL OF YOU JAMIE I SAID FULL OF MY OWN IMPORTANCE WHEN I'VE COME SO FAR AND ALL AT NIGHT TOO TO SET YOU FREE I'M FREE ENOUGH SAID JAMIE,16.145
228-121761-0028,I DON'T WANT TO GO BEFORE THE MORNING AND HE BEGAN TO WHIMPER AGAIN DO YOU CALL THIS FREE I SAID HOLDING UP HIS WRIST WHERE THE REMNANT OF THE CORD WAS HANGING OH,15.34
228-121761-0029,SAID JAMIE THAT'S ONLY BUT ERE HE GOT FARTHER THE MOONLIGHT IN THE LOFT WAS DARKENED I LOOKED HURRIEDLY TOWARDS THE DOOR THERE STOOD THE STRANGEST FIGURE,15.78
228-121761-0030,WITH THE MOON BEHIND IT I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS THE KELPIE COME AFTER ME FOR IT WAS A TALL WOMAN MY HEART GAVE A GREAT JUMP UP BUT I SWALLOWED IT DOWN,12.98
228-121761-0031,I WOULD NOT DISGRACE MYSELF BEFORE JAMIE IT WAS NOT THE KELPIE HOWEVER BUT THE KEEPER'S SISTER,7.94
228-121761-0032,I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE HER APPEARANCE IT WAS PECULIAR ENOUGH FOR SHE HAD JUST GOT OUT OF BED AND THROWN AN OLD SHAWL ABOUT HER SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK AT,12.66
228-121761-0033,FOR AS JAMIE EXPLAINED TO ME AFTERWARDS THE CORD WHICH WAS TIED TO HIS WRIST INSTEAD OF BEING MEANT TO KEEP HIM A PRISONER WAS A DEVICE OF HER KINDNESS TO KEEP HIM FROM BEING TOO FRIGHTENED,13.54
228-121761-0034,THE OTHER END HAD BEEN TIED TO HER WRIST THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED HE MIGHT PULL HER,5.575
228-121761-0035,SHE SAID IN A GRUFF VOICE AS SHE ADVANCED ALONG THE STREAM OF MOONLIGHT I STOOD UP AS BRAVELY AS I COULD IT'S ONLY ME MISS ADAM I SAID AND WHO ARE YOU,15.59
228-121761-0036,SHE RETURNED RANALD BANNERMAN I ANSWERED OH SHE SAID IN A PUZZLED TONE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AT THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT,14.39

228-121761-0038,YES THANK YOU MA'AM QUITE COMFORTABLE SAID JAMIE WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE BUT PLEASE MA'AM RANALD DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM HE'S A HOUSEBREAKER THOUGH,14.13
228-121761-0039,AND HE'D BETTER GO HOME AGAIN AS FAST AS HE CAN IF JOHN ADAM SHOULD COME OUT I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OR PERHAPS HE'D LIKE TO STOP AND KEEP YOU COMPANY NO THANK YOU MISS ADAM,14.855
228-121761-0040,I SAID I WILL GO HOME COME ALONG THEN AND LET ME SHUT THE DOOR AFTER YOU SOMEWHAT NETTLED WITH JAMIE DUFF'S INDIFFERENCE TO MY WELL MEANT EXERTIONS ON HIS BEHALF,13.14
228-121761-0041,I FOLLOWED HER WITHOUT EVEN BIDDING HIM GOOD NIGHT OH YOU'VE GOT MISSY HAVE YOU SHE SAID SPYING HER WHERE SHE STOOD WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK OF MILK OR A PIECE OF OATCAKE BEFORE YOU GO,14.285
228-121761-0042,NO THANK YOU I SAID I SHALL BE GLAD TO GO TO BED I SHOULD THINK SO SHE ANSWERED JAMIE IS QUITE COMFORTABLE I ASSURE YOU AND I'LL TAKE CARE HE'S IN TIME FOR SCHOOL IN THE MORNING,15.135
228-121761-0043,THERE'S NO HARM IN HIM POOR THING SHE UNDID THE BRIDLE FOR ME HELPED ME TO MOUNT IN THE KINDEST WAY BADE ME GOOD NIGHT AND STOOD LOOKING AFTER ME TILL I WAS SOME DISTANCE OFF,14.345
228-121761-0044,I WENT HOME AT A GOOD GALLOP TOOK OFF THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LAID THEM IN A CART IN THE SHED TURNED MISSY LOOSE INTO THE STABLE SHUT THE DOOR AND RAN ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE MANSE,14.005
228-121761-0045,DESIRING NOTHING BUT BED WHEN I CAME NEAR THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK I SAW A FIGURE ENTERING THE GATE FROM THE FRONT IT WAS IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON WHICH WAS NOW UP A GOOD WAY,14.635
228-121761-0046,AND PEEPING ROUND SAW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CORRECT IT WAS THE KELPIE SHE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER VERY SOFTLY AFRAID OF BEING LOCKED OUT A DANGER WHICH HAD SCARCELY OCCURRED TO ME BEFORE,16.995
228-121761-0047,SHE GAVE A CRY OF ALARM BUT PRESENTLY OPENED THE DOOR LOOKING PALE AND FRIGHTENED WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF DOORS THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT SHE ASKED BUT WITHOUT QUITE HER USUAL ARROGANCE,14.575
228-121761-0048,FOR ALTHOUGH SHE TRIED TO PUT IT ON HER VOICE TREMBLED TOO MUCH I RETORTED THE QUESTION WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT YOURSELF I SAID,13.945
228-121761-0049,LOOKING AFTER YOU OF COURSE THAT'S WHY YOU LOCKED THE DOOR I SUPPOSE TO KEEP ME OUT SHE HAD NO ANSWER READY BUT LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME,13.41
228-121761-0050,I SHALL LET YOUR FATHER KNOW OF YOUR GOINGS ON SHE SAID RECOVERING HERSELF A LITTLE YOU NEED NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE I SHALL TELL HIM MYSELF AT BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE,15.125
228-121761-0051,YOU HAD BETTER TELL HIM TOO I SAID THIS NOT THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE SHE HAD BEEN OUT TO LOOK FOR ME BUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE HAD LOCKED THE DOOR TO ANNOY ME,11.68
228-121761-0052,FOR DOORS WERE SELDOM LOCKED IN THE SUMMER NIGHTS IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY SHE MADE ME NO REPLY BUT TURNED AND LEFT ME NOT EVEN SHUTTING THE DOOR,11.45
228-131212-0000,THE NEXT MORNING DIAMOND WAS UP ALMOST AS EARLY AS BEFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM HIS MOTHER NOW AND MADE NO SECRET OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT BY THE TIME HE REACHED THE STABLE SEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE THERE,13.645
228-131212-0001,AND HE TOLD THEM ALL THEY WANTED TO KNOW BUT WHEN HE PROCEEDED TO HARNESS THE OLD HORSE THEY PUSHED HIM ASIDE WITH ROUGH KINDNESS CALLED HIM A BABY AND BEGAN TO DO IT ALL FOR HIM,11.91
228-131212-0002,SO DIAMOND RAN IN AND HAD ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO TIRED AS HE WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED QUITE FRESH THIS MORNING IT WAS A CLOUDY DAY AND THE WIND BLEW HARD FROM THE NORTH,15.415
228-131212-0003,SO HARD SOMETIMES THAT PERCHED ON THE BOX WITH JUST HIS TOES TOUCHING THE GROUND,5.95
228-131212-0004,LEST HE SHOULD BE BLOWN AWAY BUT HE DID NOT REALLY MIND IT HIS HEAD WAS FULL OF THE DREAM HE HAD DREAMED,8.68
228-131212-0005,FOR HIS WORK WAS NOT TO DIG STARS BUT TO DRIVE OLD DIAMOND AND PICK UP FARES THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO CAN THINK ABOUT BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND DO COMMON WORK AT THE SAME TIME BUT THEN THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND,14.67
228-131212-0006,THERE WAS NOT MUCH BUSINESS DOING AND DIAMOND FELT RATHER COLD NOTWITHSTANDING HIS MOTHER HAD HERSELF PUT ON HIS COMFORTER AND HELPED HIM WITH HIS GREATCOAT BUT HE WAS TOO WELL AWARE OF HIS DIGNITY TO GET INSIDE HIS CAB AS SOME DO,15.035
228-131212-0007,A CABMAN OUGHT TO BE ABOVE MINDING THE WEATHER AT LEAST SO DIAMOND THOUGHT AT LENGTH HE WAS CALLED TO A NEIGHBOURING HOUSE,8.66
228-131212-0008,FOR THE ROUGHS WERE IN GREAT FORCE HOWEVER THERE BEING NO BLOCK NOT EVEN IN NIGHTINGALE LANE HE REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE WHARF AND SET DOWN HIS PASSENGER WITHOUT ANNOYANCE,11.98
228-131212-0009,BUT AS HE TURNED TO GO BACK SOME IDLERS NOT CONTENT WITH CHAFFING HIM SHOWED A MIND TO THE FARE THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM THEY WERE JUST PULLING HIM OFF THE BOX AND DIAMOND WAS SHOUTING FOR THE POLICE WHEN A PALE FACED MAN,14.55
228-131212-0010,CAME UP AND MAKING GOOD USE OF HIS STICK DROVE THEM OFF NOW MY LITTLE MAN HE SAID GET ON WHILE YOU CAN,9.865
228-131212-0011,BUT DIAMOND WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF THINKING ONLY OF HIMSELF HE SAW THAT HIS NEW FRIEND LOOKED WEARY IF NOT ILL AND VERY POOR WON'T YOU JUMP IN SIR HE SAID I WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU LIKE,15.6
228-131212-0012,THANK YOU MY MAN BUT I HAVE NO MONEY SO I CAN'T OH I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY I SHALL BE MUCH HAPPIER IF YOU WILL GET IN YOU HAVE SAVED ME ALL I HAD I OWE YOU A LIFT SIR,13.77
228-131212-0013,WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING TO CHARING CROSS BUT I DON'T MIND WHERE I GO WELL I AM VERY TIRED IF YOU WILL TAKE ME TO CHARING CROSS I SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU I HAVE WALKED FROM GRAVESEND,15.185
228-131212-0014,SO SAYING HE OPENED THE DOOR AND GOT IN AND DIAMOND DROVE AWAY BUT AS HE DROVE HE COULD NOT HELP FANCYING HE HAD SEEN THE GENTLEMAN FOR DIAMOND KNEW HE WAS A GENTLEMAN BEFORE,14.595
228-131212-0015,DO ALL HE COULD HOWEVER HE COULD NOT RECALL WHERE OR WHEN,4.415
228-131212-0016,WHOM THE RELIEF OF BEING CARRIED HAD MADE LESS AND LESS INCLINED TO CARRY HIMSELF HAD BEEN TURNING OVER THINGS IN HIS MIND AND AS THEY PASSED THE MINT CALLED TO DIAMOND,10.8650625
228-131212-0017,IF YOU DIDN'T MIND TAKING ME TO CHISWICK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY YOU WHEN WE GOT THERE IT'S A LONG WAY BUT YOU SHALL HAVE THE WHOLE FARE FROM THE DOCKS AND SOMETHING OVER VERY WELL SIR SAID DIAMOND I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY,13.755
228-131212-0018,HE WAS JUST CLAMBERING UP AGAIN WHEN THE GENTLEMAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAID IT'S THE WILDERNESS MISTER COLEMAN'S PLACE BUT I'LL DIRECT YOU WHEN WE COME INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT FLASHED UPON DIAMOND WHO HE WAS,15.29
228-131212-0019,BUT HE GOT UPON HIS BOX TO ARRANGE HIS THOUGHTS BEFORE MAKING ANY REPLY THE GENTLEMAN WAS MISTER EVANS TO WHOM MISS COLEMAN WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED,9.665
228-131212-0020,I HAVE SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEHAVED VERY WELL TO MISS COLEMAN HE HAD PUT OFF THEIR MARRIAGE MORE THAN ONCE IN A COWARDLY FASHION,8.44
228-131212-0021,WHEN A MAN THINKS OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY IN SUCH A CASE HE MAY LOVE BUT HIS LOVE IS BUT A POOR AFFAIR MISTER COLEMAN TOOK HIM INTO THE FIRM AS A JUNIOR PARTNER,11.385
228-131212-0022,AND IT WAS IN A MEASURE THROUGH HIS INFLUENCE THAT HE ENTERED UPON THOSE SPECULATIONS WHICH RUINED HIM SO HIS LOVE HAD NOT BEEN A BLESSING THE SHIP WHICH NORTH WIND HAD SUNK WAS THEIR LAST VENTURE,13.23
228-131212-0023,AND MISTER EVANS HAD GONE OUT WITH IT IN THE HOPE OF TURNING ITS CARGO TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE WAS ONE OF THE SINGLE BOAT LOAD WHICH MANAGED TO REACH A DESERT ISLAND,8.99
228-131212-0024,BUT HE WAS NOT PAST BEING TAUGHT AND HIS TROUBLES HAD DONE HIM NO END OF GOOD FOR THEY HAD MADE HIM DOUBT HIMSELF,6.78
228-131212-0025,AND HUNT FOR HER FOOD AND MAKE CLOTHES FOR HER HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE MOST FORTUNATE OF MEN,5.925
228-131212-0026,IN WHICH CASE IT IS THE ONE FRIGHTFUL THING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO HE HAD COME BACK A MORE HUMBLE MAN AND LONGING TO ASK MISS COLEMAN TO FORGIVE HIM BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT RUIN HAD FALLEN UPON THEM,15.005
228-131212-0027,FOR HE HAD NEVER MADE HIMSELF THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIRM'S AFFAIRS FEW SPECULATIVE PEOPLE DO KNOW THEIR OWN AFFAIRS HENCE HE NEVER DOUBTED HE SHOULD FIND MATTERS MUCH AS HE LEFT THEM,11.135
228-131212-0028,BUT IF HE HAD NOT FALLEN IN WITH DIAMOND HE WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING THERE FIRST WHAT WAS DIAMOND TO DO HE HAD HEARD HIS FATHER AND MOTHER DROP SOME REMARKS CONCERNING MISTER EVANS WHICH MADE HIM DOUBTFUL OF HIM,14.165
228-131212-0029,IT WAS OF COURSE OF NO USE TO DRIVE MISTER EVANS TO CHISWICK BUT IF HE SHOULD TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THEM AND WHERE THEY LIVED NOW HE MIGHT PUT OFF GOING TO SEE THEM AND HE WAS CERTAIN THAT MISS COLEMAN AT LEAST MUST WANT VERY MUCH TO SEE MISTER EVANS,15.955
228-131212-0030,THE MOMENT HE CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION HE CHANGED HIS COURSE FROM WESTWARD TO NORTHWARD AND WENT STRAIGHT FOR MISTER COLEMAN'S POOR LITTLE HOUSE IN HOXTON,9.355
228-131212-0031,AND HAD NO SUSPICION THEREFORE OF THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION BY THIS TIME THE WIND HAD INCREASED ALMOST TO A HURRICANE AND AS THEY HAD OFTEN TO HEAD IT IT WAS NO JOKE FOR EITHER OF THE DIAMONDS THE DISTANCE HOWEVER WAS NOT GREAT,15.11
228-131212-0032,BEFORE THEY REACHED THE STREET WHERE MISTER COLEMAN LIVED IT BLEW SO TREMENDOUSLY THAT WHEN MISS COLEMAN WHO WAS GOING OUT A LITTLE WAY OPENED THE DOOR IT DASHED AGAINST THE WALL WITH SUCH A BANG THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO VENTURE AND WENT IN AGAIN,14.775
228-131212-0033,OLD DIAMOND HAD SO MUCH ADO TO STOP THE CAB AGAINST IT,3.745
228-131212-0034,YOUNG DIAMOND JUMPED OFF HIS BOX,2.52
228-131212-0035,THEN TURNED TO THE CAB AND SAID BEFORE MISTER EVANS HAD QUITE BEGUN TO THINK SOMETHING MUST BE AMISS PLEASE SIR MY HARNESS HAS GIVEN AWAY WOULD YOU MIND STEPPING IN HERE FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY'RE FRIENDS OF MINE I'LL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU LIKE AFTER I'VE GOT IT MENDED,16.405
228-131212-0036,HALF STUPID WITH FATIGUE AND WANT OF FOOD MISTER EVANS YIELDED TO THE BOY'S SUGGESTION AND WALKED IN AT THE DOOR WHICH THE MAID HELD WITH DIFFICULTY AGAINST THE WIND SHE TOOK MISTER EVANS FOR A VISITOR AS INDEED HE WAS,13.85
228-131212-0037,AND SHOWED HIM INTO THE ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR,2.64
228-131212-0038,TELL MISS COLEMAN IT'S MISS COLEMAN HE WANTS TO SEE I DON'T KNOW SAID THE MAID HE DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN HE IS THOUGH AND I KNOW HIM AND SO DOES MISS COLEMAN,13.72
228-131212-0039,THE MAID COULD NOT BUT REMEMBER DIAMOND HAVING SEEN HIM WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER BROUGHT THE LADIES HOME SO SHE BELIEVED HIM,7.565
228-131212-0040,WHICH IS ALL ABOUT DIAMOND IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT MISS COLEMAN THOUGHT MISTER EVANS WAS DEAD PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE MANAGED DIFFERENTLY THERE WAS A CRY AND A RUNNING TO AND FRO IN THE HOUSE,11.995
228-131212-0041,ALMOST AS SOON AS MISTER EVANS WENT IN THE WIND BEGAN TO CEASE AND WAS NOW STILL DIAMOND FOUND THAT BY MAKING THE BREECHING JUST A LITTLE TIGHTER THAN WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE FOR THE OLD HORSE HE COULD DO VERY WELL FOR THE PRESENT,14.245
228-131212-0042,AND THINKING IT BETTER TO LET HIM HAVE HIS BAG IN THIS QUIET PLACE,4.145
228-131212-0043,IN A LITTLE WHILE MISTER EVANS CAME OUT AND ASKED HIM TO COME IN DIAMOND OBEYED AND TO HIS DELIGHT MISS COLEMAN PUT HER ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIM AND THERE WAS PAYMENT FOR HIM NOT TO MENTION THE FIVE PRECIOUS SHILLINGS SHE GAVE HIM,14.085
228-131212-0044,WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WANTED THEM SO MUCH AT HOME FOR HIS FATHER HE LEFT THEM NEARLY AS HAPPY AS THEY WERE THEMSELVES THE REST OF THE DAY HE DID BETTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SO MUCH TO TAKE HOME AS THE DAY BEFORE,14.775
228-131212-0045,AND HOW HE HAD DONE AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT THEY ASKED HIM SUCH A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH HE COULD ANSWER AND SOME OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ANSWER AND HIS FATHER SEEMED EVER SO MUCH BETTER FROM FINDING THAT HIS BOY WAS ALREADY NOT ONLY USEFUL TO HIS FAMILY BUT USEFUL TO OTHER PEOPLE,16.565
228-131212-0046,AND DID WORK WORTH DOING FOR A FORTNIGHT DIAMOND WENT ON DRIVING HIS CAB AND KEEPING HIS FAMILY HE HAD BEGUN TO BE KNOWN ABOUT SOME PARTS OF LONDON,12.025
228-131212-0047,ONE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED NEAR THE MEWS ENGAGED HIM TO CARRY HIM TO THE CITY EVERY MORNING AT A CERTAIN HOUR AND DIAMOND WAS PUNCTUAL AS CLOCKWORK THOUGH TO EFFECT THAT REQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF CARE FOR HIS FATHER'S WATCH WAS NOT MUCH TO BE DEPENDED ON,14.24
228-131212-0048,BETWEEN THE TWO HOWEVER HE DID MAKE A SUCCESS OF IT AFTER THAT FORTNIGHT HIS FATHER WAS ABLE TO GO OUT AGAIN,7.725
228-133094-0000,CHILD AND GARDEN FLOWER AND SUN VANISH ALL THINGS MORTAL AS THE BUILDING SHADOWS FALL AS THE RAYS DIMINISH UNDER EVENING'S CLOAK THEY ALL,16.065

238-122530-0006,THERE APPENDICITIS I TOLD YOU SO POOR MADAME VELMA LET US HOPE IT WON'T GET INTO THE LOCAL PAPERS OH GOODNESS,8.47
238-122530-0007,I SAY MISS CHAMPION I WAS CHAFFING THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT SHARPS AND FLATS I CAN PLAY THAT ACCOMPANIMENT FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE NO WELL JUST AS YOU THINK BEST,9.505
238-122530-0008,NOW THE DUCHESS HAS DONE COME ON MIND THE BOTTOM STEP HANG IT ALL HOW DARK IT IS BEHIND THIS CURTAIN GARTH GAVE HER HIS HAND AND JANE MOUNTED THE STEPS AND PASSED INTO VIEW OF THE LARGE AUDIENCE ASSEMBLED IN THE OVERDENE CONCERT ROOM,15.865
238-122530-0009,HER TALL FIGURE SEEMED TALLER THAN USUAL AS SHE WALKED ALONE ACROSS THE RATHER HIGH PLATFORM,5.445
238-122530-0010,WITH OLD LACE AT HER BOSOM AND ONE STRING OF PEARLS ROUND HER NECK WHEN SHE APPEARED THE AUDIENCE GAZED AT HER AND APPLAUDED DOUBTFULLY VELMA'S NAME ON THE PROGRAMME HAD RAISED GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND HERE WAS MISS CHAMPION WHO CERTAINLY PLAYED VERY NICELY,14.64
238-122530-0011,VOLUNTEERING TO SING VELMA'S SONG,2.56
238-122530-0012,VOICING ITS GENEROUS APPRECIATION OF HER EFFORT AND SANGUINE EXPECTATION OF HER SUCCESS THIS AUDIENCE EXPRESSED ITS ASTONISHMENT IN THE DUBIOUSNESS OF ITS FAINT APPLAUSE JANE SMILED AT THEM GOOD NATUREDLY SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO,15.025
238-122530-0013,A BECHSTEIN GRAND GLANCED AT THE FESTOONS OF WHITE ROSES AND THE CROSS OF CRIMSON RAMBLERS THEN WITHOUT FURTHER PRELIMINARIES STRUCK THE OPENING CHORD AND COMMENCED TO SING THE DEEP PERFECT VOICE THRILLED THROUGH THE ROOM,15.18
238-122530-0014,A SUDDEN BREATHLESS HUSH FELL UPON THE AUDIENCE EACH SYLLABLE PENETRATED THE SILENCE BORNE ON A TONE SO TENDER AND SO AMAZINGLY SWEET THAT CASUAL HEARTS STOOD STILL AND MARVELLED AT THEIR OWN EMOTION,14.12
238-122530-0015,AND THOSE WHO FELT DEEPLY ALREADY RESPONDED WITH A YET DEEPER THRILL TO THE MAGIC OF THAT MUSIC THE HOURS I SPENT WITH THEE DEAR HEART ARE AS A STRING OF PEARLS TO ME I COUNT THEM OVER EV'RY ONE APART MY ROSARY,15.645
238-122530-0016,MY ROSARY SOFTLY THOUGHTFULLY TENDERLY THE LAST TWO WORDS WERE BREATHED INTO THE SILENCE HOLDING A WORLD OF REMINISCENCE A LARGE HEARTED WOMAN'S FAITHFUL REMEMBRANCE OF TENDER MOMENTS IN THE PAST,15.8
238-122530-0017,THE LISTENING CROWD HELD ITS BREATH THIS WAS NOT A SONG THIS WAS THE THROBBING OF A HEART AND IT THROBBED IN TONES OF SUCH SWEETNESS THAT TEARS STARTED UNBIDDEN THEN THE VOICE WHICH HAD RENDERED THE OPENING LINES SO QUIETLY,15.635
238-122530-0018,ROSE IN A RAPID CRESCENDO OF QUIVERING PAIN EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL A PRAYER TO STILL A HEART IN ABSENCE WRUNG I TELL EACH BEAD UNTO THE END AND THERE A CROSS IS HUNG,14.455
238-122530-0019,THE LAST FOUR WORDS WERE GIVEN WITH A SUDDEN POWER AND PASSION,3.965
238-122530-0020,BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE QUIET VOICE FELL SOOTHINGLY EXPRESSING A STRENGTH OF ENDURANCE WHICH WOULD FAIL IN NO CRISIS NOR FEAR TO FACE ANY DEPTHS OF PAIN YET GATHERING TO ITSELF A POIGNANCY OF SWEETNESS,14.21
238-122530-0021,RENDERED RICHER BY THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS,15.595
238-122530-0022,CAN POSSIBLY REALISE HOW SHE SANG I KISS EACH BEAD THE LINGERING RETROSPECTION IN EACH WORD BREATHED OUT A LOVE SO WOMANLY SO BEAUTIFUL SO TENDER THAT HER IDENTITY WAS FORGOTTEN EVEN BY THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO KNEW HER BEST,16.415
238-122530-0023,IN THE MAGIC OF HER RENDERING OF THE SONG THE ACCOMPANIMENT WHICH OPENS WITH A SINGLE CHORD CLOSES WITH A SINGLE NOTE JANE STRUCK IT SOFTLY LINGERINGLY THEN ROSE TURNED FROM THE PIANO,16.08
238-122530-0024,AND WAS LEAVING THE PLATFORM WHEN A SUDDEN BURST OF WILD APPLAUSE BROKE FROM THE AUDIENCE JANE HESITATED PAUSED LOOKED AT HER AUNT'S GUESTS AS IF ALMOST SURPRISED TO FIND THEM THERE THEN THE SLOW SMILE DAWNED IN HER EYES AND PASSED TO HER LIPS,16.13
238-122530-0025,THEN MOVED ON AS MEN'S VOICES BEGAN TO SHOUT ENCORE,3.77
238-122530-0026,LEFT THE PLATFORM BY THE SIDE STAIRCASE BUT THERE BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE SEMI DARKNESS OF SCREENS AND CURTAINS A FRESH SURPRISE AWAITED JANE MORE STARTLING THAN THE ENTHUSIASTIC TUMULT OF HER AUDIENCE,12.795
238-122530-0027,AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE STOOD GARTH DALMAIN HIS FACE WAS ABSOLUTELY COLOURLESS AND HIS EYES SHONE OUT FROM IT LIKE BURNING STARS HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS UNTIL SHE STEPPED FROM THE LAST STAIR AND STOOD CLOSE TO HIM THEN WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT,15.43
238-122530-0028,HE CAUGHT HER BY THE SHOULDERS AND TURNED HER ROUND GO BACK HE SAID AND THE OVERMASTERING NEED QUIVERING IN HIS VOICE DREW JANE'S EYES TO HIS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT GO BACK AT ONCE AND SING IT ALL OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD,15.35
238-122530-0029,GO BACK AT ONCE DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YOU MUST JANE LOOKED INTO THOSE SHINING EYES SOMETHING SHE SAW IN THEM EXCUSED THE BRUSQUE COMMAND OF HIS TONE,11.25
238-122530-0030,WITHOUT A WORD SHE QUIETLY MOUNTED THE STEPS AND WALKED ACROSS THE PLATFORM TO THE PIANO PEOPLE WERE STILL APPLAUDING AND REDOUBLED THEIR DEMONSTRATIONS OF DELIGHT AS SHE APPEARED BUT JANE TOOK HER SEAT AT THE INSTRUMENT WITHOUT GIVING THEM A THOUGHT,14.05
238-122530-0031,SHE WAS EXPERIENCING A VERY CURIOUS AND UNUSUAL SENSATION NEVER BEFORE IN HER WHOLE LIFE HAD SHE OBEYED A PEREMPTORY COMMAND IN HER CHILDHOOD'S DAYS,11.2
238-122530-0032,AN UNREASONABLE ORDER OR A REASONABLE ONE UNEXPLAINED PROMPTLY MET WITH A POINT BLANK REFUSAL AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC STILL OBTAINED THOUGH MODIFIED BY TIME AND EVEN THE DUCHESS AS A RULE SAID PLEASE TO JANE,14.065
238-122530-0033,BUT NOW A YOUNG MAN WITH A WHITE FACE AND BLAZING EYES HAD UNCEREMONIOUSLY SWUNG HER ROUND ORDERED HER UP THE STAIRS AND COMMANDED HER TO SING A SONG OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD AND SHE WAS MEEKLY GOING TO OBEY,14.12
238-122530-0034,AS SHE TOOK HER SEAT JANE SUDDENLY MADE UP HER MIND NOT TO SING THE ROSARY AGAIN SHE HAD MANY FINER SONGS IN HER REPERTOIRE THE AUDIENCE EXPECTED ANOTHER WHY SHOULD SHE DISAPPOINT THOSE EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE OF THE IMPERIOUS DEMANDS OF,14.6200625
238-122530-0035,A VERY HIGHLY EXCITED BOY SHE COMMENCED THE MAGNIFICENT PRELUDE TO HANDEL'S WHERE'ER YOU WALK BUT AS SHE PLAYED IT HER SENSE OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE INTERVENED SHE HAD NOT COME BACK TO SING AGAIN AT THE BIDDING OF A HIGHLY EXCITED BOY,15.505
238-122530-0036,BUT OF A DEEPLY MOVED MAN AND HIS EMOTION WAS OF NO ORDINARY KIND THAT GARTH DALMAIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO MOVED AS TO FORGET EVEN MOMENTARILY,9.115
238-122530-0037,WHILE SHE PLAYED THE HANDEL THEME,2.07
238-122530-0038,SHE SUDDENLY REALISED THOUGH SCARCELY UNDERSTANDING IT THE MUST OF WHICH GARTH HAD SPOKEN AND MADE UP HER MIND TO YIELD TO ITS NECESSITY SO WHEN THE OPENING BARS WERE ENDED,11.76
238-122530-0039,SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT STRUCK ONCE MORE THE ROSARY'S OPENING CHORD AND DID AS GARTH HAD BIDDEN HER TO DO THE HOURS I SPENT WITH THEE DEAR HEART ARE AS A STRING OF PEARLS TO ME I COUNT THEM OVER EV'RY ONE APART,14.84
238-122530-0040,MY ROSARY MY ROSARY EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL A PRAYER TO STILL A HEART IN ABSENCE WRUNG I TELL EACH BEAD UNTO THE END AND THERE A CROSS IS HUNG O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN,15.975
238-122530-0041,O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS WHEN JANE LEFT THE PLATFORM GARTH WAS STILL STANDING MOTIONLESS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS,15.555
238-122530-0042,HIS FACE WAS JUST AS WHITE AS BEFORE BUT HIS EYES HAD LOST THAT TERRIBLE LOOK OF UNSHED TEARS WHICH HAD SENT HER BACK AT HIS BIDDING WITHOUT A WORD OF QUESTION OR REMONSTRANCE A WONDERFUL LIGHT NOW SHONE IN THEM A LIGHT OF ADORATION WHICH TOUCHED JANE'S HEART,15.25
238-122530-0043,SHE SMILED AS SHE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS,2.835
238-122530-0044,WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENT OF GRACIOUS FRIENDLINESS GARTH STEPPED CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AND TOOK THEM IN HIS WHILE SHE WAS STILL ON THE STEP ABOVE HIM FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT SPEAK THEN IN A LOW VOICE VIBRANT WITH EMOTION,15.805
238-122530-0045,MY GOD HE SAID OH MY GOD HUSH SAID JANE I NEVER LIKE TO HEAR THAT NAME SPOKEN LIGHTLY DAL SPOKEN LIGHTLY HE EXCLAIMED NO SPEAKING LIGHTLY WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO NIGHT,14.31
238-122530-0046,EVERY PERFECT GIFT IS FROM ABOVE WHEN WORDS FAIL ME TO SPEAK OF THE GIFT CAN YOU WONDER IF I APOSTROPHISE THE GIVER,7.815
238-122530-0047,SO YOU LIKED MY SONG SHE SAID LIKED,3.345
238-122530-0048,REPEATED GARTH A SHADE OF PERPLEXITY CROSSING HIS FACE I DO,4.625
238-122530-0049,BECAUSE SAID GARTH VERY LOW YOU LIFTED THE VEIL AND I I PASSED WITHIN,7.4
238-122530-0050,AND AS HE SPOKE THE LAST TWO WORDS HE TURNED THEM GENTLY OVER AND BENDING KISSED EACH PALM WITH AN INDESCRIBABLY TENDER REVERENCE THEN LOOSING THEM,10.91
25-123319-0000,A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE IN IRELAND,7.11
25-123319-0001,SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE IT IS A MELANCHOLY OBJECT TO THOSE WHO WALK THROUGH THIS GREAT TOWN OR TRAVEL IN THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY SEE THE STREETS THE ROADS AND CABBIN DOORS,15.31
25-123319-0002,THESE MOTHERS INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO WORK FOR THEIR HONEST LIVELIHOOD ARE FORCED TO EMPLOY ALL THEIR TIME IN STROLING TO BEG SUSTENANCE FOR THEIR HELPLESS INFANTS WHO,13.735
25-123319-0003,TO FIGHT FOR THE PRETENDER IN SPAIN OR SELL THEMSELVES TO THE BARBADOES,5.865
25-123319-0004,A VERY GREAT ADDITIONAL GRIEVANCE AND THEREFORE WHOEVER COULD FIND OUT A FAIR CHEAP AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING THESE CHILDREN,9.625
25-123319-0005,IT IS OF A MUCH GREATER EXTENT,2.905
25-123319-0006,AT A CERTAIN AGE WHO ARE BORN OF PARENTS IN EFFECT AS LITTLE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AS THOSE WHO DEMAND OUR CHARITY IN THE STREETS AS TO MY OWN PART HAVING TURNED MY THOUGHTS FOR MANY YEARS UPON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT,16.61
25-123319-0007,I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THEM GROSSLY MISTAKEN IN THEIR COMPUTATION IT IS TRUE A CHILD JUST DROPT FROM ITS DAM MAY BE SUPPORTED BY HER MILK FOR A SOLAR YEAR WITH LITTLE OTHER NOURISHMENT,13.105
25-123319-0008,WHICH THE MOTHER MAY CERTAINLY GET OR THE VALUE IN SCRAPS BY HER LAWFUL OCCUPATION OF BEGGING AND IT IS EXACTLY AT ONE YEAR OLD THAT I PROPOSE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM,12.195
25-123319-0009,IN SUCH A MANNER AS INSTEAD OF BEING A CHARGE UPON THEIR PARENTS OR THE PARISH,5.31
25-123319-0010,THEY SHALL ON THE CONTRARY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEEDING AND PARTLY TO THE CLOATHING OF MANY THOUSANDS THERE IS LIKEWISE ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IN MY SCHEME,13.69
25-123319-0011,THAT IT WILL PREVENT THOSE VOLUNTARY ABORTIONS AND THAT HORRID PRACTICE OF WOMEN MURDERING THEIR BASTARD CHILDREN ALAS TOO FREQUENT AMONG US,12.21
25-123319-0012,SACRIFICING THE POOR INNOCENT BABES I DOUBT MORE TO AVOID THE EXPENCE THAN THE SHAME WHICH WOULD MOVE TEARS AND PITY IN THE MOST SAVAGE AND INHUMAN BREAST,13.405
25-123319-0013,THE NUMBER OF SOULS IN THIS KINGDOM BEING USUALLY RECKONED ONE MILLION AND A HALF OF THESE I CALCULATE THERE MAY BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND COUPLE WHOSE WIVES ARE BREEDERS,13.86
25-123319-0014,WHO ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CHILDREN ALTHOUGH I APPREHEND THERE CANNOT BE SO MANY UNDER THE PRESENT DISTRESSES OF THE KINGDOM BUT THIS BEING GRANTED THERE WILL REMAIN,12.545
25-123319-0015,AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND BREEDERS I AGAIN SUBTRACT FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THOSE WOMEN WHO MISCARRY OR WHOSE CHILDREN DIE BY ACCIDENT OR DISEASE WITHIN THE YEAR,11.46
25-123319-0016,THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS HOW THIS NUMBER SHALL BE REARED AND PROVIDED FOR WHICH AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID UNDER THE PRESENT SITUATION OF AFFAIRS IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE BY ALL THE METHODS HITHERTO PROPOSED,16.55
25-123319-0017,FOR WE CAN NEITHER EMPLOY THEM IN HANDICRAFT OR AGRICULTURE WE NEITHER BUILD HOUSES I MEAN IN THE COUNTRY NOR CULTIVATE LAND THEY CAN VERY SELDOM PICK UP A LIVELIHOOD BY STEALING TILL THEY ARRIVE AT SIX YEARS OLD,15.785
25-123319-0018,EXCEPT WHERE THEY ARE OF TOWARDLY PARTS ALTHOUGH I CONFESS THEY LEARN THE RUDIMENTS MUCH EARLIER DURING WHICH TIME THEY CAN HOWEVER BE PROPERLY LOOKED UPON ONLY AS PROBATIONERS,12.495
25-123319-0019,WHO PROTESTED TO ME THAT HE NEVER KNEW ABOVE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES UNDER THE AGE OF SIX EVEN IN A PART OF THE KINGDOM SO RENOWNED FOR THE QUICKEST PROFICIENCY IN THAT ART,12.89
25-123319-0020,I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY A VERY KNOWING AMERICAN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE IN LONDON THAT A YOUNG HEALTHY CHILD WELL NURSED IS AT A YEAR OLD A MOST DELICIOUS,13.605
25-123319-0021,NOURISHING AND WHOLESOME FOOD WHETHER STEWED ROASTED BAKED OR BOILED AND I MAKE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL EQUALLY SERVE IN A FRICASIE OR A RAGOUST,12.85
25-123319-0022,I DO THEREFORE HUMBLY OFFER IT TO PUBLICK CONSIDERATION THAT OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN ALREADY COMPUTED TWENTY THOUSAND MAY BE RESERVED FOR BREED WHEREOF ONLY ONE FOURTH PART TO BE MALES,15.105
25-123319-0023,BLACK CATTLE OR SWINE AND MY REASON IS THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE SELDOM THE FRUITS OF MARRIAGE A CIRCUMSTANCE NOT MUCH REGARDED BY OUR SAVAGES THEREFORE ONE MALE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SERVE FOUR FEMALES,15.985
25-123319-0024,AND WHEN THE FAMILY DINES ALONE THE FORE OR HIND QUARTER WILL MAKE A REASONABLE DISH AND SEASONED WITH A LITTLE PEPPER OR SALT WILL BE VERY GOOD BOILED ON THE FOURTH DAY ESPECIALLY IN WINTER,12.525
25-123319-0025,I HAVE RECKONED UPON A MEDIUM THAT A CHILD JUST BORN WILL WEIGH TWELVE POUNDS AND IN A SOLAR YEAR IF TOLERABLY NURSED ENCREASETH TO TWENTY EIGHT POUNDS,11.545
25-123319-0026,I GRANT THIS FOOD WILL BE SOMEWHAT DEAR AND THEREFORE VERY PROPER FOR LANDLORDS WHO AS THEY HAVE ALREADY DEVOURED MOST OF THE PARENTS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST TITLE TO THE CHILDREN INFANT'S FLESH WILL BE IN SEASON THROUGHOUT THE YEAR,15.52
25-123319-0027,BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF POPISH INFANTS IS AT LEAST THREE TO ONE IN THIS KINGDOM AND THEREFORE IT WILL HAVE ONE OTHER COLLATERAL ADVANTAGE BY LESSENING THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS AMONG US,13.81
25-123319-0028,I HAVE ALREADY COMPUTED THE CHARGE OF NURSING A BEGGAR'S CHILD,4.635
25-123319-0029,TO BE ABOUT TWO SHILLINGS PER ANNUM RAGS INCLUDED,4.48
25-123319-0030,FOR THE CARCASS OF A GOOD FAT CHILD WHICH AS I HAVE SAID WILL MAKE FOUR DISHES OF EXCELLENT NUTRITIVE MEAT WHEN HE HATH ONLY SOME PARTICULAR FRIEND OR HIS OWN FAMILY TO DINE WITH HIM THUS THE SQUIRE WILL LEARN TO BE A GOOD LANDLORD,16.17
25-123319-0031,AND GROW POPULAR AMONG HIS TENANTS THE MOTHER WILL HAVE EIGHT SHILLINGS NEAT PROFIT AND BE FIT FOR WORK TILL SHE PRODUCES ANOTHER CHILD THOSE WHO ARE MORE THRIFTY AS I MUST CONFESS THE TIMES REQUIRE,14.105
25-123319-0032,AS TO OUR CITY OF DUBLIN SHAMBLES MAY BE APPOINTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE MOST CONVENIENT PARTS OF IT AND BUTCHERS WE MAY BE ASSURED WILL NOT BE WANTING ALTHOUGH I RATHER RECOMMEND,13.19
25-123319-0033,BUYING THE CHILDREN ALIVE AND DRESSING THEM HOT FROM THE KNIFE AS WE DO ROASTING PIGS A VERY WORTHY PERSON,9.49
25-123319-0034,A TRUE LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHOSE VIRTUES I HIGHLY ESTEEM WAS LATELY PLEASED IN DISCOURSING ON THIS MATTER TO OFFER A REFINEMENT UPON MY SCHEME HE SAID THAT MANY GENTLEMEN OF THIS KINGDOM,14.55
25-123319-0035,NOT EXCEEDING FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOR UNDER TWELVE SO GREAT A NUMBER OF BOTH SEXES IN EVERY COUNTRY BEING NOW READY TO STARVE FOR WANT OF WORK AND SERVICE AND THESE TO BE DISPOSED OF BY THEIR PARENTS IF ALIVE,15.73
25-123319-0036,FOR AS TO THE MALES MY AMERICAN ACQUAINTANCE ASSURED ME FROM FREQUENT EXPERIENCE THAT THEIR FLESH WAS GENERALLY TOUGH AND LEAN LIKE THAT OF OUR SCHOOL BOYS BY CONTINUAL EXERCISE AND THEIR TASTE DISAGREEABLE,15.7
25-123319-0037,AND TO FATTEN THEM WOULD NOT ANSWER THE CHARGE,3.16
25-123319-0038,BUT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY MY FRIEND HE CONFESSED THAT THIS EXPEDIENT WAS PUT INTO HIS HEAD BY THE FAMOUS SALMANAAZOR A NATIVE OF THE ISLAND FORMOSA,11.485
25-123319-0039,WHO CAME FROM THENCE TO LONDON ABOVE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IN CONVERSATION TOLD MY FRIEND THAT IN HIS COUNTRY WHEN ANY YOUNG PERSON HAPPENED TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE EXECUTIONER SOLD THE CARCASS TO PERSONS OF QUALITY AS A PRIME DAINTY,15.895
25-123319-0040,AND THAT IN HIS TIME THE BODY OF A PLUMP GIRL OF FIFTEEN WHO WAS CRUCIFIED FOR AN ATTEMPT TO POISON THE EMPEROR WAS SOLD TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY'S PRIME MINISTER OF STATE AND OTHER GREAT MANDARINS OF THE COURT,14.555
25-123319-0041,CANNOT STIR ABROAD WITHOUT A CHAIR,2.77
25-123319-0042,AND I HAVE BEEN DESIRED TO EMPLOY MY THOUGHTS WHAT COURSE MAY BE TAKEN TO EASE THE NATION OF SO GRIEVOUS AN INCUMBRANCE BUT I AM NOT IN THE LEAST PAIN UPON THAT MATTER,11.745
25-123319-0043,BECAUSE IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT THEY ARE EVERY DAY DYING AND ROTTING BY COLD AND FAMINE AND FILTH AND VERMIN,7.2
25-123319-0044,THEY CANNOT GET WORK AND CONSEQUENTLY PINE AWAY FROM WANT OF NOURISHMENT,4.91
25-123319-0045,THEY HAVE NOT STRENGTH TO PERFORM IT AND THUS THE COUNTRY AND THEMSELVES ARE HAPPILY DELIVERED FROM THE EVILS TO COME I HAVE TOO LONG DIGRESSED AND THEREFORE SHALL RETURN TO MY SUBJECT,12.48
25-123319-0046,I THINK THE ADVANTAGES BY THE PROPOSAL WHICH I HAVE MADE ARE OBVIOUS AND MANY AS WELL AS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE FOR FIRST AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED,13.39
25-123319-0047,IT WOULD GREATLY LESSEN THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS WITH WHOM WE ARE YEARLY OVER RUN BEING THE PRINCIPAL BREEDERS OF THE NATION AS WELL AS OUR MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES AND WHO,12.44
25-123319-0048,STAY AT HOME ON PURPOSE WITH A DESIGN TO DELIVER THE KINGDOM TO THE PRETENDER HOPING TO TAKE THEIR ADVANTAGE BY THE ABSENCE OF SO MANY GOOD PROTESTANTS WHO HAVE CHOSEN RATHER TO LEAVE THEIR COUNTRY THAN STAY AT HOME AND PAY TITHES,15.515
25-123319-0049,AGAINST THEIR CONSCIENCE TO AN EPISCOPAL CURATE SECONDLY THE POORER TENANTS WILL HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE OF THEIR OWN WHICH BY LAW,11.025
25-123319-0050,THEIR CORN AND CATTLE BEING ALREADY SEIZED AND MONEY A THING UNKNOWN THIRDLY WHEREAS THE MAINTAINANCE OF AN HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM TWO YEARS OLD AND UPWARDS CANNOT BE COMPUTED AT LESS THAN TEN SHILLINGS A PIECE PER ANNUM,16.3
25-123319-0051,BESIDES THE PROFIT OF A NEW DISH INTRODUCED TO THE TABLES OF ALL GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE IN THE KINGDOM WHO HAVE ANY REFINEMENT IN TASTE AND THE MONEY WILL CIRCULATE AMONG OUR SELVES THE GOODS BEING ENTIRELY OF OUR OWN GROWTH AND MANUFACTURE,15.59
25-123319-0052,THIS FOOD WOULD LIKEWISE BRING GREAT CUSTOM TO TAVERNS WHERE THE VINTNERS WILL CERTAINLY BE SO PRUDENT AS TO PROCURE THE BEST RECEIPTS FOR DRESSING IT TO PERFECTION AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE THEIR HOUSES FREQUENTED BY ALL THE FINE GENTLEMEN,14.925
25-123319-0053,WHO JUSTLY VALUE THEMSELVES UPON THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN GOOD EATING AND A SKILFUL COOK WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW TO OBLIGE HIS GUESTS WILL CONTRIVE TO MAKE IT AS EXPENSIVE AS THEY PLEASE SIXTHLY,15.155
25-123319-0054,THIS WOULD BE A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO MARRIAGE WHICH ALL WISE NATIONS HAVE EITHER ENCOURAGED BY REWARDS OR ENFORCED BY LAWS AND PENALTIES IT WOULD ENCREASE THE CARE AND TENDERNESS OF MOTHERS TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN,15.12
25-123319-0055,WHICH OF THEM COULD BRING THE FATTEST CHILD TO THE MARKET MEN WOULD BECOME AS FOND OF THEIR WIVES DURING THE TIME OF THEIR PREGNANCY AS THEY ARE NOW OF THEIR MARES IN FOAL THEIR COWS IN CALF,14.27
25-123319-0056,NOR OFFER TO BEAT OR KICK THEM AS IS TOO FREQUENT A PRACTICE FOR FEAR OF A MISCARRIAGE MANY OTHER ADVANTAGES MIGHT BE ENUMERATED FOR INSTANCE,12.28
25-123319-0057,THE PROPAGATION OF SWINE'S FLESH AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE ART OF MAKING GOOD BACON SO MUCH WANTED AMONG US BY THE GREAT DESTRUCTION OF PIGS TOO FREQUENT AT OUR TABLES,11.345
25-123319-0058,WHICH ROASTED WHOLE WILL MAKE A CONSIDERABLE FIGURE AT A LORD MAYOR'S FEAST,5.97
25-123319-0059,BUT THIS AND MANY OTHERS I OMIT BEING STUDIOUS OF BREVITY SUPPOSING THAT ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THIS CITY WOULD BE CONSTANT CUSTOMERS FOR INFANTS FLESH BESIDES,15.045
25-123319-0060,OTHERS WHO MIGHT HAVE IT AT MERRY MEETINGS PARTICULARLY AT WEDDINGS AND CHRISTENINGS I COMPUTE THAT DUBLIN WOULD TAKE OFF ANNUALLY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND CARCASSES,11.655
25-123319-0061,AND THE REST OF THE KINGDOM WHERE PROBABLY THEY WILL BE SOLD SOMEWHAT CHEAPER THE REMAINING EIGHTY THOUSAND,7.765
25-123319-0062,THIS I FREELY OWN AND TWAS INDEED ONE PRINCIPAL DESIGN IN OFFERING IT TO THE WORLD I DESIRE THE READER WILL OBSERVE THAT I CALCULATE MY REMEDY FOR THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL KINGDOM OF IRELAND,15.17
25-123319-0063,AND FOR NO OTHER THAT EVER WAS IS OR I THINK EVER CAN BE UPON EARTH THEREFORE LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF OTHER EXPEDIENTS,11.475
25-123319-0064,OF UTTERLY REJECTING THE MATERIALS AND INSTRUMENTS THAT PROMOTE FOREIGN LUXURY,5.125
25-123319-0065,VANITY IDLENESS AND GAMING IN OUR WOMEN OF INTRODUCING A VEIN OF PARSIMONY PRUDENCE AND TEMPERANCE OF LEARNING TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY WHEREIN WE DIFFER EVEN FROM LAPLANDERS AND THE INHABITANTS OF,14.6
25-123319-0066,OF BEING A LITTLE CAUTIOUS NOT TO SELL OUR COUNTRY AND CONSCIENCES FOR NOTHING,5.285
25-123319-0067,LASTLY OF PUTTING A SPIRIT OF HONESTY INDUSTRY AND SKILL INTO OUR SHOP KEEPERS WHO,8.37
25-123319-0068,THE MEASURE AND THE GOODNESS NOR COULD EVER YET BE BROUGHT TO MAKE ONE FAIR PROPOSAL OF JUST DEALING THOUGH OFTEN AND EARNESTLY INVITED TO IT THEREFORE I REPEAT,14.51
25-123319-0069,LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF THESE AND THE LIKE EXPEDIENTS TILL HE HATH AT LEAST SOME GLYMPSE OF HOPE THAT THERE WILL EVER BE SOME HEARTY AND SINCERE ATTEMPT TO PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE BUT,14.135
25-123319-0070,AS TO MY SELF HAVING BEEN WEARIED OUT FOR MANY YEARS WITH OFFERING VAIN IDLE VISIONARY THOUGHTS AND AT LENGTH UTTERLY DESPAIRING OF SUCCESS I FORTUNATELY FELL UPON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH AS IT IS WHOLLY NEW,15.64
25-123319-0071,FULL IN OUR OWN POWER AND WHEREBY WE CAN INCUR NO DANGER,5.585
25-123319-0072,FOR THIS KIND OF COMMODITY WILL NOT BEAR EXPORTATION AND FLESH BEING OF TOO TENDER A CONSISTENCE TO ADMIT A LONG CONTINUANCE IN SALT,9.75
25-123319-0073,ALTHOUGH PERHAPS I COULD NAME A COUNTRY WHICH WOULD BE GLAD TO EAT UP OUR WHOLE NATION WITHOUT IT AFTER ALL I AM NOT SO VIOLENTLY BENT UPON MY OWN OPINION AS TO REJECT ANY OFFER PROPOSED BY WISE MEN,16.025
25-123319-0074,WHICH SHALL BE FOUND EQUALLY INNOCENT CHEAP EASY AND EFFECTUAL BUT BEFORE SOMETHING OF THAT KIND SHALL BE ADVANCED IN CONTRADICTION TO MY SCHEME AND OFFERING A BETTER I DESIRE THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS,15.595

25-88353-0037,TO CONTINUE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN PRIVATE PASSION IN THE THEATRE AND CROWD PASSION IN THE PHOTOPLAY LET US TURN TO SHAW AGAIN CONSIDER HIS ILLUSTRATION OF IAGO OTHELLO AND LEAR THESE PARTS AS HE IMPLIES,15.275
25-88353-0038,WOULD FALL FLAT IN MOTION PICTURES THE MINOR SITUATIONS OF DRAMATIC INTENSITY MIGHT IN MANY CASES BE BUILT UP THE CRISIS WOULD INEVITABLY FAIL IAGO AND OTHELLO AND LEAR,15.87
25-88353-0039,ARE ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE PERSONS INDIVIDUALS IN EXTREMIS IF YOU GO TO A MOTION PICTURE AND FEEL YOURSELF SUDDENLY GRIPPED BY THE HIGHEST DRAMATIC TENSION AS ON THE OLD STAGE AND REFLECT AFTERWARD THAT IT WAS A FIGHT BETWEEN ONLY,16.605

25-88353-0046,SOMETHING THE PHOTOPLAYS THAT TRACE STRICTLY PERSONAL HATREDS CANNOT ACHIEVE THE BIRTH OF A NATION IS A CROWD PICTURE IN A TRIPLE SENSE ON THE FILMS AS IN THE AUDIENCE,14.105
25-88353-0047,IT TURNS THE CROWD INTO A MOB THAT IS EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON'S POISONOUS HATRED OF THE NEGRO GRIFFITH IS A CHAMELEON IN INTERPRETING HIS AUTHORS WHEREVER THE SCENARIO SHOWS TRACES OF THE CLANSMAN,16.985

25-88353-0051,BUT IT IS STILL TRUE THAT IT IS A WONDER IN ITS GRIFFITH SECTIONS IN ITS HANDLING OF MASSES OF MEN IT FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE PRINCIPLES THAT MADE NOTABLE THE OLD ONE REEL BATTLE FILM DESCRIBED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER,15.755
25-88353-0052,THE BATTLE IN THE END IS GREATER BECAUSE OF ITS SELF POSSESSION AND CONCENTRATION ALL PACKED INTO TWENTY MINUTES WHEN IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION LINCOLN,15.205

29-123027-0001,AND NEARER THE ROAD TO EARLSHALL LED THROUGH WOODS THAT BELONGED TO THE EARL THE SOUND CAME IN THAT DIRECTION AND I HOPED IT MIGHT BE SOME ONE COMING IN SEARCH OF US AS THE SOUND CAME NEARER AND NEARER,14.61
29-123027-0002,I WAS ALMOST SURE I COULD DISTINGUISH GINGER'S STEP,3.625

29-123027-0004,FEEL HOW COLD HIS HANDS ARE THEY RAISED HIM UP BUT THERE WAS NO LIFE AND HIS HAIR WAS SOAKED WITH BLOOD THEY LAID HIM DOWN AGAIN AND CAME AND LOOKED AT ME,14.45
29-123027-0005,THEY SOON SAW MY CUT KNEES WHY THE HORSE HAS BEEN DOWN AND THROWN HIM,6.335
29-123027-0006,LOOK HERE HIS HOOF IS CUT ALL TO PIECES HE MIGHT WELL COME DOWN POOR FELLOW I TELL YOU WHAT NED I'M AFRAID IT HASN'T BEEN ALL RIGHT WITH REUBEN JUST THINK OF HIS RIDING A HORSE OVER THESE STONES WITHOUT A SHOE,16.12
29-123027-0007,I'M AFRAID IT HAS BEEN THE OLD THING OVER AGAIN POOR SUSAN SHE LOOKED AWFULLY PALE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE TO ASK IF HE HAD NOT COME HOME SHE MADE BELIEVE SHE WAS NOT A BIT ANXIOUS,13.365
29-123027-0008,BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE BEGGED ME TO GO AND MEET HIM BUT WHAT MUST WE DO THERE'S THE HORSE TO GET HOME AS WELL AS THE BODY AND THAT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER,12.195
29-123027-0009,BUT SHE KNEW AS WELL AS I DID WHAT WAS GOING ON AND STOOD AS STILL AS A STONE I NOTICED THAT BECAUSE IF SHE HAD A FAULT IT WAS THAT SHE WAS IMPATIENT IN STANDING,11.41
29-123027-0010,I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT WALK IT WAS MORE THAN THREE MILES ROBERT LED ME ON VERY SLOWLY,7.905
29-123027-0011,WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN,15.14
29-123027-0012,AND AFTER ROBERT HAD WRAPPED UP MY KNEES IN WET CLOTHS HE TIED UP MY FOOT IN A BRAN POULTICE TO DRAW OUT THE HEAT AND CLEANSE IT BEFORE THE HORSE DOCTOR SAW IT IN THE MORNING AND I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF DOWN ON THE STRAW,15.525
29-123027-0013,AND SLEPT IN SPITE OF THE PAIN THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE FARRIER HAD EXAMINED MY WOUNDS HE SAID HE HOPED THE JOINT WAS NOT INJURED AND IF SO I SHOULD NOT BE SPOILED FOR WORK,16.625
29-123027-0014,BUT I SHOULD NEVER LOSE THE BLEMISH I BELIEVE THEY DID THE BEST TO MAKE A GOOD CURE BUT IT WAS A LONG AND PAINFUL ONE PROUD FLESH AS THEY CALLED IT CAME UP IN MY KNEES AND WAS BURNED OUT WITH CAUSTIC,15.51
29-123027-0015,AND WHEN AT LAST IT WAS HEALED THEY PUT A BLISTERING FLUID OVER THE FRONT OF BOTH KNEES TO BRING ALL THE HAIR OFF THEY HAD SOME REASON FOR THIS AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AS SMITH'S DEATH HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN,15.58
29-123027-0016,AND MY SHOE WAS PICKED UP AMONG THE STONES SO THAT THE CASE WAS QUITE PLAIN TO THEM AND I WAS CLEARED OF ALL BLAME EVERYBODY PITIED SUSAN SHE WAS NEARLY OUT OF HER MIND,14.195
29-123027-0017,SO SHE WENT ON TILL AFTER HE WAS BURIED AND THEN AS SHE HAD NO HOME OR RELATIONS,7.31
29-123032-0000,A HUMBUG MY MASTER WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY SUITED BUT IN A FEW DAYS,9.105
29-123032-0001,IN FACT HE DID A GREAT DEAL OF STROKING AND PATTING,3.43
29-123032-0002,HE ALWAYS BRUSHED MY MANE AND TAIL WITH WATER AND MY HOOFS WITH OIL BEFORE HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR TO MAKE ME LOOK SMART,8.66

29-123032-0004,CONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY HANDSOME HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ABOUT HIS HAIR WHISKERS AND NECKTIE BEFORE A LITTLE LOOKING GLASS IN THE HARNESS ROOM WHEN HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IT WAS ALWAYS YES SIR,14.9
29-123032-0005,TOUCHING HIS HAT AT EVERY WORD,2.62
29-123032-0006,WHILE THE STRONG VAPORS THAT ROSE MADE MY EYES SMART AND INFLAME AND I DID NOT FEEL THE SAME APPETITE FOR MY FOOD ONE DAY HIS MASTER CAME IN AND SAID ALFRED THE STABLE SMELLS RATHER STRONG,14.825

29-123032-0012,NOW THE FACT WAS THAT HE HARDLY EVER DID EXERCISE ME AND WHEN THE MASTER WAS BUSY I OFTEN STOOD FOR DAYS TOGETHER WITHOUT STRETCHING MY LEGS AT ALL AND YET BEING FED JUST AS HIGH AS IF I WERE AT HARD WORK,14.365
29-123032-0013,THIS OFTEN DISORDERED MY HEALTH AND MADE ME SOMETIMES HEAVY AND DULL BUT MORE OFTEN RESTLESS AND FEVERISH HE NEVER EVEN GAVE ME A MEAL OF GREEN FOOD OR A BRAN MASH WHICH WOULD HAVE COOLED ME,14.595
29-123032-0014,FOR HE WAS ALTOGETHER AS IGNORANT AS HE WAS CONCEITED AND THEN INSTEAD OF EXERCISE OR CHANGE OF FOOD I HAD TO TAKE HORSE BALLS AND DRAUGHTS WHICH BESIDE THE NUISANCE OF HAVING THEM POURED DOWN MY THROAT,13.45
29-123032-0015,USED TO MAKE ME FEEL ILL AND UNCOMFORTABLE ONE DAY MY FEET WERE SO TENDER,7.21
29-123032-0016,I MADE TWO SUCH SERIOUS STUMBLES THAT AS HE CAME DOWN LANSDOWN INTO THE CITY HE STOPPED AT THE FARRIER'S AND ASKED HIM TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH ME,10.65
29-123032-0017,THE MAN TOOK UP MY FEET ONE BY ONE AND EXAMINED THEM THEN STANDING UP AND DUSTING HIS HANDS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER HE SAID YOUR HORSE HAS GOT THE THRUSH AND BADLY TOO,12.625
29-123032-0018,HIS FEET ARE VERY TENDER IT IS FORTUNATE THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN DOWN I WONDER YOUR GROOM HAS NOT SEEN TO IT BEFORE THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WE FIND IN FOUL STABLES WHERE THE LITTER IS NEVER PROPERLY CLEANED OUT IF YOU WILL SEND HIM HERE TO MORROW,15.275
29-123032-0019,I WILL ATTEND TO THE HOOF AND I WILL DIRECT YOUR MAN HOW TO APPLY THE LINIMENT WHICH I WILL GIVE HIM THE NEXT DAY I HAD MY FEET THOROUGHLY CLEANSED AND STUFFED WITH TOW SOAKED IN SOME STRONG LOTION,14.98
29-123032-0020,THE FARRIER ORDERED ALL THE LITTER TO BE TAKEN OUT OF MY BOX DAY BY DAY AND THE FLOOR KEPT VERY CLEAN THEN I WAS TO HAVE BRAN MASHES A LITTLE GREEN FOOD AND NOT SO MUCH CORN,13.85
29-123032-0021,TILL MY FEET WERE WELL AGAIN WITH THIS TREATMENT I SOON REGAINED MY SPIRITS BUT MISTER BARRY WAS SO MUCH DISGUSTED AT BEING TWICE DECEIVED BY HIS GROOMS THAT HE DETERMINED TO GIVE UP KEEPING A HORSE,15.255

29-126858-0002,BUT YOU COULD NOT DO THIS WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU BECAUSE NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU CAME TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ALWAYS FACING YOU AND BESIDES ONLY ONE HALF OF HIM SLEPT AT A TIME THE OTHER HEAD WAS ALWAYS AWAKE,15.69
29-126858-0003,IN ALL WEATHERS FOR PUSHMI PULLYUS NOT A SINGLE ONE HAD EVER BEEN CAUGHT EVEN THEN YEARS AGO HE WAS THE ONLY ANIMAL IN THE WORLD WITH TWO HEADS WELL,14.265

29-126858-0005,THE PUSHMI PULLYU HEARD THEM COMING AND HE TRIED HARD TO BREAK THROUGH THE RING OF MONKEYS BUT HE COULDN'T DO IT WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NO USE TRYING TO ESCAPE HE SAT DOWN AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT THEY WANTED,13.13
29-126858-0006,THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO WITH DOCTOR DOLITTLE AND BE PUT ON SHOW IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN BUT HE SHOOK BOTH HIS HEADS HARD AND SAID CERTAINLY NOT,11.51
29-126858-0007,THEY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SHUT UP IN A MENAGERIE BUT WOULD JUST BE LOOKED AT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DOCTOR WAS A VERY KIND MAN BUT HADN'T ANY MONEY AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO SEE A TWO HEADED ANIMAL AND THE DOCTOR WOULD GET RICH,13.97
29-126858-0008,AND COULD PAY FOR THE BOAT HE HAD BORROWED TO COME TO AFRICA IN BUT HE ANSWERED NO YOU KNOW HOW SHY I AM I HATE BEING STARED AT AND HE ALMOST BEGAN TO CRY,14.11
29-126858-0009,HE SAID HE WOULD COME WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A MAN THE DOCTOR WAS FIRST SO THE MONKEYS TRAVELED BACK WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU AND WHEN THEY CAME TO WHERE THE DOCTOR'S LITTLE HOUSE OF GRASS WAS THEY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR THE DUCK,15.835

29-130626-0012,WITH GENERAL DEPRESSION OVER THE MIDLAND COUNTIES LONDON AND CHANNEL BAR FALLING I DO THINK THAT OF ALL THE SILLY IRRITATING TOMFOOLISHNESS BY WHICH WE ARE PLAGUED THIS WEATHER FORECAST FRAUD,14.325
29-130626-0013,IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN,13.925
29-130626-0014,BY OUR PAYING ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER REPORT OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER HEAVY SHOWERS WITH THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DAY IT WOULD SAY ON MONDAY AND SO WE WOULD GIVE UP OUR PICNIC AND STOP INDOORS ALL DAY WAITING FOR THE RAIN,14.81
29-130626-0015,AND PEOPLE WOULD PASS THE HOUSE GOING OFF IN WAGONETTES AND COACHES AS JOLLY AND MERRY AS COULD BE THE SUN SHINING OUT AND NOT A CLOUD TO BE SEEN AH WE SAID AS WE STOOD LOOKING OUT AT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW WON'T THEY COME HOME SOAKED,15.63

29-130626-0017,THE LANDLADY WOULD COME IN TO ASK IF WE WEREN'T GOING OUT AS IT SEEMED SUCH A LOVELY DAY NO NO WE REPLIED WITH A KNOWING CHUCKLE NOT WE WE DON'T MEAN TO GET WET NO NO AND WHEN THE AFTERNOON WAS NEARLY GONE AND STILL THERE WAS NO SIGN OF RAIN,16.84
29-130626-0018,AND A LOVELY NIGHT AFTER IT THE NEXT MORNING WE WOULD READ THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A WARM FINE TO SET FAIR DAY MUCH HEAT AND WE WOULD DRESS OURSELVES IN FLIMSY THINGS,11.955
29-130626-0019,IT WOULD COMMENCE TO RAIN HARD AND A BITTERLY COLD WIND WOULD SPRING UP AND BOTH WOULD KEEP ON STEADILY FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND WE WOULD COME HOME WITH COLDS AND RHEUMATISM ALL OVER US AND GO TO BED,12.665
29-130626-0020,THE WEATHER IS A THING THAT IS BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE BAROMETER IS USELESS IT IS AS MISLEADING AS THE NEWSPAPER FORECAST,10.89
29-130626-0021,THERE WAS ONE HANGING UP IN A HOTEL AT OXFORD AT WHICH I WAS STAYING LAST SPRING AND WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS POINTING TO SET FAIR IT WAS SIMPLY POURING WITH RAIN OUTSIDE AND HAD BEEN ALL DAY AND I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE MATTERS OUT,15.32
29-130626-0022,AND IT JUMPED UP AND POINTED TO VERY DRY THE BOOTS STOPPED AS HE WAS PASSING AND SAID HE EXPECTED IT MEANT TO MORROW I FANCIED THAT MAYBE IT WAS THINKING OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST BUT BOOTS SAID NO HE THOUGHT NOT,14.46

29-130626-0024,MUCH HEAT UNTIL IT WAS STOPPED BY THE PEG AND COULDN'T GO ANY FURTHER IT TRIED ITS BEST,6.14
29-130626-0025,WITHOUT BREAKING ITSELF IT EVIDENTLY WANTED TO GO ON AND PROGNOSTICATE DROUGHT AND WATER FAMINE AND SUNSTROKE AND SIMOOMS AND SUCH THINGS BUT THE PEG PREVENTED IT,12.665
29-130626-0026,BOOTS SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED SPELL OF GRAND WEATHER SOME TIME AND READ OUT A POEM WHICH WAS PRINTED OVER THE TOP OF THE ORACLE ABOUT LONG FORETOLD LONG LAST,13.445

29-130626-0047,BUT ON CATCHING SIGHT OF HARRIS AND ME AND MONTMORENCY AND THE THINGS HE EASED UP AND STARED HARRIS AND I FROWNED AT HIM THIS MIGHT HAVE WOUNDED A MORE SENSITIVE NATURE,12.54
29-130626-0048,BUT BIGGS'S BOYS ARE NOT AS A RULE TOUCHY HE CAME TO A DEAD STOP A YARD FROM OUR STEP,7.705

31-121969-0001,TOOK WHOLE AND SOLE POSSESSION OF THEY WERE HER ENTIRE PROPERTY AS EXPRESSLY MADE TO CONVEY TO CAUDLE'S BRAIN THE STREAM OF WISDOM THAT CONTINUALLY FLOWED FROM THE LIPS OF HIS WIFE,13.635
31-121969-0002,AS WAS THE TIN FUNNEL THROUGH WHICH MISSUS CAUDLE IN VINTAGE TIME BOTTLED HER ELDER WINE THERE WAS HOWEVER THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WISDOM AND THE WINE THE WINE WAS ALWAYS SUGARED,15.335
31-121969-0003,THE WISDOM NEVER IT WAS EXPRESSED CRUDE FROM THE HEART OF MISSUS CAUDLE WHO DOUBTLESS TRUSTED TO THE SWEETNESS OF HER HUSBAND'S DISPOSITION TO MAKE IT AGREE WITH HIM,11.355
31-121969-0004,PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DEBATED WHETHER MORNING OR NIGHT IS MOST CONDUCIVE TO THE STRONGEST AND CLEAREST MORAL IMPRESSIONS THE GRECIAN SAGE CONFESSED THAT HIS LABOURS SMELT OF THE LAMP,11.8
31-121969-0005,IN LIKE MANNER DID MISSUS CAUDLE'S WISDOM SMELL OF THE RUSHLIGHT SHE KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND WAS TOO MUCH DISTRACTED BY HIS BUSINESS,9.45

31-121969-0008,BESIDES MISSUS CAUDLE COPIED VERY ANCIENT AND CLASSIC AUTHORITY,4.79
31-121969-0009,SO WAS MISSUS CAUDLE LIKE THE OWL SHE HOOTED ONLY AT NIGHT MISTER CAUDLE WAS BLESSED WITH AN INDOMITABLE CONSTITUTION ONE FACT WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF THIS,14.64
31-121969-0010,HE LIVED THIRTY YEARS WITH MISSUS CAUDLE SURVIVING HER YES IT TOOK THIRTY YEARS FOR MISSUS CAUDLE TO LECTURE AND DILATE UPON THE JOYS GRIEFS DUTIES AND VICISSITUDES COMPRISED WITHIN THAT SEEMINGLY SMALL CIRCLE,15.175
31-121969-0011,THE WEDDING RING WE SAY SEEMINGLY SMALL FOR THE THING AS VIEWED BY THE VULGAR NAKED EYE IS A TINY HOOP MADE FOR THE THIRD FEMININE FINGER,12.2
31-121969-0012,ALACK LIKE THE RING OF SATURN FOR GOOD OR EVIL IT CIRCLES A WHOLE WORLD OR TO TAKE A LESS GIGANTIC FIGURE IT COMPASSES A VAST REGION IT MAY BE ARABIA FELIX,13.4
31-121969-0013,AND IT MAY BE ARABIA PETREA A LEMON HEARTED CYNIC MIGHT LIKEN THE WEDDING RING TO AN ANCIENT CIRCUS IN WHICH WILD ANIMALS CLAWED ONE ANOTHER FOR THE SPORT OF LOOKERS ON,14.34
31-121969-0014,PERISH THE HYPERBOLE WE WOULD RATHER COMPARE IT TO AN ELFIN RING IN WHICH DANCING FAIRIES MADE THE SWEETEST MUSIC FOR INFIRM HUMANITY MANIFOLD ARE THE USES OF RINGS,14.37
31-121969-0015,EVEN SWINE ARE TAMED BY THEM YOU WILL SEE A VAGRANT HILARIOUS DEVASTATING PORKER A FULL BLOODED FELLOW THAT WOULD BLEED INTO MANY MANY FATHOMS OF BLACK PUDDING YOU WILL SEE HIM ESCAPED FROM HIS PROPER HOME STRAYING IN A NEIGHBOUR'S GARDEN,15.49
31-121969-0016,HOW HE TRAMPLES UPON THE HEART'S EASE HOW WITH QUIVERING SNOUT HE ROOTS UP LILIES ODORIFEROUS BULBS HERE HE GIVES A RECKLESS SNATCH AT THYME AND MARJORAM AND HERE HE MUNCHES VIOLETS AND GILLY FLOWERS,12.92
31-121969-0017,AT LENGTH THE MARAUDER IS DETECTED SEIZED BY HIS OWNER AND DRIVEN BEATEN HOME TO MAKE THE PORKER LESS DANGEROUS IT IS DETERMINED THAT HE SHALL BE RINGED THE SENTENCE IS PRONOUNCED EXECUTION ORDERED,15.185
31-121969-0018,LISTEN TO HIS SCREAMS WOULD YOU NOT THINK THE KNIFE WAS IN HIS THROAT AND YET THEY'RE ONLY BORING THROUGH HIS NOSE HENCE FOR ALL FUTURE TIME THE PORKER BEHAVES HIMSELF WITH A SORT OF FORCED PROPRIETY,13.85
31-121969-0019,FOR IN EITHER NOSTRIL HE CARRIES A RING IT IS FOR THE GREATNESS OF HUMANITY A SADDENING THOUGHT THAT SOMETIMES MEN MUST BE TREATED NO BETTER THAN PIGS,9.955
31-121969-0020,BUT MISTER JOB CAUDLE WAS NOT OF THESE MEN MARRIAGE TO HIM WAS NOT MADE A NECESSITY NO FOR HIM CALL IT IF YOU WILL A HAPPY CHANCE A GOLDEN ACCIDENT IT IS HOWEVER ENOUGH FOR US TO KNOW THAT HE WAS MARRIED,14.93
31-121969-0021,AND WAS THEREFORE MADE THE RECIPIENT OF A WIFE'S WISDOM MISSUS CAUDLE LIKE MAHOMET'S DOVE CONTINUALLY PECKED AT THE GOOD MAN'S EARS AND IT IS A HAPPINESS TO LEARN FROM WHAT HE LEFT BEHIND,14.39
31-121969-0022,THAT HE HAD HIVED ALL HER SAYINGS IN HIS BRAIN AND FURTHER THAT HE EMPLOYED THE MELLOW EVENING OF HIS LIFE TO PUT SUCH SAYINGS DOWN THAT IN DUE SEASON THEY MIGHT BE ENSHRINED IN IMPERISHABLE TYPE,14.43
31-121969-0023,HE WAS IN THE RIPE FULNESS OF FIFTY SEVEN FOR THREE HOURS AT LEAST AFTER HE WENT TO BED SUCH SLAVES ARE WE TO HABIT HE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE HIS WIFE STILL TALKED AT HIS SIDE,15.325
31-121969-0024,TRUE IT WAS SHE WAS DEAD AND DECENTLY INTERRED HIS MIND IT WAS A COMFORT TO KNOW IT COULD NOT WANDER ON THIS POINT THIS HE KNEW NEVERTHELESS HIS WIFE WAS WITH HIM,12.41
31-121969-0025,THE GHOST OF HER TONGUE STILL TALKED AS IN THE LIFE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN DID JOB CAUDLE HEAR THE MONITIONS OF BYGONE YEARS AT TIMES SO LOUD SO LIVELY SO REAL WERE THE SOUNDS THAT JOB WITH A COLD CHILL,15.645
31-121969-0026,DOUBTED IF HE WERE REALLY WIDOWED AND THEN WITH THE MOVEMENT OF AN ARM A FOOT HE WOULD ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS ALONE IN HIS HOLLAND NEVERTHELESS THE TALK CONTINUED IT WAS TERRIBLE TO BE THUS HAUNTED BY A VOICE,16.115
31-121969-0027,TO HAVE ADVICE COMMANDS REMONSTRANCE ALL SORTS OF SAWS AND ADAGES STILL POURED UPON HIM AND NO VISIBLE WIFE NOW DID THE VOICE SPEAK FROM THE CURTAINS NOW FROM THE TESTER AND NOW DID IT WHISPER TO JOB FROM THE VERY PILLOW THAT HE PRESSED,15.82
31-121969-0028,IT'S A DREADFUL THING THAT HER TONGUE SHOULD WALK IN THIS MANNER SAID JOB AND THEN HE THOUGHT CONFUSEDLY OF EXORCISM OR AT LEAST OF COUNSEL FROM THE PARISH PRIEST,10.73

36-16602-0027,TO MY MIND THEY KNOW TOO MUCH AND FEEL TOO OBVIOUSLY I CANNOT STOMACH THE HEARTINESS WITH WHICH THEY SLAP ME ON THE BACK OR THE EMOTION WITH WHICH THEY HURL THEMSELVES ON MY BOSOM,14.285
36-16602-0028,AND THEIR DREAMS A TRIFLE DULL I DO NOT LIKE THEM I AM ON THE SHELF I WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS BUT,11.1
36-16602-0029,I SHOULD BE THRICE A FOOL IF I DID IT FOR AUGHT BUT MY OWN ENTERTAINMENT,6.505
36-16602-0030,BUT ALL THIS IS BY THE WAY I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN I WROTE MY FIRST BOOK BY A LUCKY CHANCE IT EXCITED ATTENTION AND VARIOUS PERSONS SOUGHT MY ACQUAINTANCE,10.785
36-16602-0031,IT IS NOT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY THAT I WANDER AMONG MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WORLD OF LETTERS IN LONDON WHEN FIRST BASHFUL BUT EAGER I WAS INTRODUCED TO IT IT IS LONG SINCE I FREQUENTED IT AND,13.58
36-16602-0032,IF THE NOVELS THAT DESCRIBE ITS PRESENT SINGULARITIES ARE ACCURATE,4.36
36-16602-0033,THE VENUE IS DIFFERENT CHELSEA AND BLOOMSBURY HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF HAMPSTEAD NOTTING HILL GATE AND HIGH STREET KENSINGTON,8.305

36-16602-0035,THE MORE OBVIOUS FORMS OF PRETENTIOUSNESS,3.525
36-16602-0036,BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER SO CRUDE A PROMISCUITY AS SEEMS TO BE PRACTISED IN THE PRESENT DAY WE DID NOT THINK IT HYPOCRITICAL TO DRAW OVER OUR VAGARIES THE CURTAIN OF A DECENT SILENCE,13.37
36-16602-0037,THE SPADE WAS NOT INVARIABLY CALLED A BLOODY SHOVEL WOMAN HAD NOT YET ALTOGETHER COME INTO HER OWN,9.065
36-16602-0038,I LIVED NEAR VICTORIA STATION AND I RECALL LONG EXCURSIONS BY BUS TO THE HOSPITABLE HOUSES OF THE LITERARY IN MY TIMIDITY I WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE STREET WHILE I SCREWED UP MY COURAGE TO RING THE BELL AND THEN,15.365
36-16602-0039,SICK WITH APPREHENSION WAS USHERED INTO AN AIRLESS ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS CELEBRATED PERSON AFTER THAT ONE AND THE KIND WORDS THEY SAID ABOUT MY BOOK MADE ME EXCESSIVELY UNCOMFORTABLE,15.99
36-16602-0040,I FELT THEY EXPECTED ME TO SAY CLEVER THINGS AND I NEVER COULD THINK OF ANY TILL AFTER THE PARTY WAS OVER I TRIED TO CONCEAL MY EMBARRASSMENT BY HANDING ROUND CUPS OF TEA AND RATHER ILL CUT BREAD AND BUTTER,14.48
36-16602-0041,I WANTED NO ONE TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME SO THAT I COULD OBSERVE THESE FAMOUS CREATURES AT MY EASE AND LISTEN TO THE CLEVER THINGS THEY SAID,11.145
36-16602-0042,I HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF LARGE UNBENDING WOMEN WITH GREAT NOSES AND RAPACIOUS EYES WHO WORE THEIR CLOTHES AS THOUGH THEY WERE ARMOUR AND OF LITTLE MOUSE LIKE SPINSTERS WITH SOFT VOICES AND A SHREWD GLANCE,16.305
36-16602-0043,I NEVER CEASED TO BE FASCINATED BY THEIR PERSISTENCE IN EATING BUTTERED TOAST WITH THEIR GLOVES ON AND I OBSERVED WITH ADMIRATION THE UNCONCERN WITH WHICH THEY WIPED THEIR FINGERS ON THEIR CHAIR WHEN THEY THOUGHT NO ONE WAS LOOKING,15.975
36-16602-0044,IT MUST HAVE BEEN BAD FOR THE FURNITURE BUT I SUPPOSE THE HOSTESS TOOK HER REVENGE ON THE FURNITURE OF HER FRIENDS WHEN IN TURN SHE VISITED THEM SOME OF THEM WERE DRESSED FASHIONABLY,12.94
36-16602-0045,NEVER PREVENTED AN EDITOR FROM TAKING YOUR STUFF,3.515
36-16602-0046,THE MEN WERE SELDOM ECCENTRIC IN APPEARANCE THEY TRIED TO LOOK AS LITTLE LIKE AUTHORS AS POSSIBLE,7.07
36-16602-0047,THEY EVER SEEMED TO ME QUITE REAL I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT THEIR CONVERSATION BRILLIANT AND I USED TO LISTEN WITH ASTONISHMENT TO,10.955
36-16602-0048,THE ARTIST HAS THIS ADVANTAGE OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT HIS FRIENDS OFFER NOT ONLY THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEIR CHARACTER TO HIS SATIRE BUT ALSO THEIR WORK,10.7
36-16602-0049,I DESPAIRED OF EVER EXPRESSING MYSELF WITH SUCH APTNESS OR WITH SUCH FLUENCY IN THOSE DAYS CONVERSATION WAS STILL CULTIVATED AS AN ART,10.655
36-16602-0050,THE EPIGRAM NOT YET A MECHANICAL APPLIANCE BY WHICH THE DULL MAY ACHIEVE A SEMBLANCE OF WIT GAVE SPRIGHTLINESS TO THE SMALL TALK OF THE URBANE IT IS SAD THAT I CAN REMEMBER NOTHING OF ALL THIS SCINTILLATION,15.03
36-16602-0051,BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION NEVER SETTLED DOWN SO COMFORTABLY AS WHEN IT TURNED TO THE DETAILS OF THE TRADE WHICH WAS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ART WE PRACTISED,12.06
36-16602-0052,WHEN WE HAD DONE DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE LATEST BOOK IT WAS NATURAL TO WONDER HOW MANY COPIES HAD BEEN SOLD WHAT ADVANCE THE AUTHOR HAD RECEIVED AND HOW MUCH HE WAS LIKELY TO MAKE OUT OF IT,12.93
36-16602-0053,THEN WE WOULD SPEAK OF THIS PUBLISHER AND OF THAT COMPARING THE GENEROSITY OF ONE WITH THE MEANNESS OF ANOTHER WE WOULD ARGUE WHETHER IT WAS BETTER TO GO TO ONE WHO GAVE HANDSOME ROYALTIES,13.15
36-16602-0054,OR TO ANOTHER WHO PUSHED A BOOK FOR ALL IT WAS WORTH SOME ADVERTISED BADLY AND SOME WELL SOME WERE MODERN AND SOME WERE OLD FASHIONED THEN WE WOULD TALK OF AGENTS AND THE OFFERS THEY HAD OBTAINED FOR US,14.185
36-16602-0055,OF EDITORS AND THE SORT OF CONTRIBUTIONS THEY WELCOMED HOW MUCH THEY PAID A THOUSAND AND WHETHER THEY PAID PROMPTLY OR OTHERWISE,9.38
36-16603-0000,CHAPTER FOUR NO ONE WAS KINDER TO ME AT THAT TIME THAN ROSE WATERFORD SHE COMBINED A MASCULINE INTELLIGENCE WITH A FEMININE PERVERSITY AND THE NOVELS SHE WROTE WERE ORIGINAL AND DISCONCERTING,15.145
36-16603-0001,IT WAS AT HER HOUSE ONE DAY THAT I MET CHARLES STRICKLAND'S WIFE MISS WATERFORD WAS GIVING A TEA PARTY AND HER SMALL ROOM WAS MORE THAN USUALLY FULL EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE TALKING AND I SITTING IN SILENCE FELT AWKWARD BUT,15.15
36-16603-0002,ROSE WATERFORD CAST DOWN HER EYES DEMURELY TO GIVE GREATER EFFECT TO HER REPLY SHE GIVES LUNCHEON PARTIES,9.26
36-16603-0003,ROSE WATERFORD WAS A CYNIC SHE LOOKED UPON LIFE AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WRITING NOVELS AND THE PUBLIC AS HER RAW MATERIAL NOW AND THEN SHE INVITED MEMBERS OF IT TO HER HOUSE IF THEY SHOWED AN APPRECIATION OF HER TALENT,14.41
36-16603-0004,AND ENTERTAINED WITH PROPER LAVISHNESS SHE HELD THEIR WEAKNESS FOR LIONS IN GOOD HUMOURED CONTEMPT BUT PLAYED TO THEM HER PART OF THE DISTINGUISHED WOMAN OF LETTERS WITH DECORUM,13.46
36-16603-0005,I WAS LED UP TO MISSUS STRICKLAND AND FOR TEN MINUTES WE TALKED TOGETHER I NOTICED NOTHING ABOUT HER EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD A PLEASANT VOICE SHE HAD A FLAT IN WESTMINSTER OVERLOOKING THE UNFINISHED CATHEDRAL AND,13.425
36-16603-0006,BECAUSE WE LIVED IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD WE FELT FRIENDLY DISPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER THE ARMY AND NAVY STORES ARE A BOND OF UNION BETWEEN ALL WHO DWELL BETWEEN THE RIVER AND SAINT JAMES'S PARK,12.825
36-16603-0007,MISSUS STRICKLAND ASKED ME FOR MY ADDRESS AND A FEW DAYS LATER I RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO LUNCHEON MY ENGAGEMENTS WERE FEW AND I WAS GLAD TO ACCEPT,11.985
36-16603-0008,WHEN I ARRIVED A LITTLE LATE BECAUSE IN MY FEAR OF BEING TOO EARLY I HAD WALKED THREE TIMES ROUND THE CATHEDRAL I FOUND THE PARTY ALREADY COMPLETE MISS WATERFORD WAS THERE AND MISSUS JAY RICHARD TWINING AND GEORGE ROAD WE WERE ALL WRITERS,15.71
36-16603-0009,WE TALKED ABOUT A HUNDRED THINGS MISS WATERFORD TORN BETWEEN THE AESTHETICISM OF HER EARLY YOUTH WHEN SHE USED TO GO TO PARTIES IN SAGE GREEN HOLDING A DAFFODIL AND THE FLIPPANCY OF HER MATURER YEARS,13.235
36-16603-0010,WHICH TENDED TO HIGH HEELS AND PARIS FROCKS WORE A NEW HAT,4.94
36-16603-0011,MISSUS JAY AWARE THAT IMPROPRIETY IS THE SOUL OF WIT MADE OBSERVATIONS IN TONES HARDLY ABOVE A WHISPER THAT,8.155
36-16603-0012,RICHARD TWINING BUBBLED OVER WITH QUAINT ABSURDITIES AND GEORGE ROAD CONSCIOUS THAT HE NEED NOT EXHIBIT A BRILLIANCY WHICH WAS ALMOST A BY WORD OPENED HIS MOUTH ONLY TO PUT FOOD INTO IT,12.905
36-16603-0013,MISSUS STRICKLAND DID NOT TALK MUCH BUT SHE HAD A PLEASANT GIFT FOR KEEPING THE CONVERSATION GENERAL AND WHEN THERE WAS A PAUSE,8.71
36-16603-0014,SHE WAS A WOMAN OF THIRTY SEVEN RATHER TALL AND PLUMP WITHOUT BEING FAT,4.48
36-16603-0015,HER SKIN WAS RATHER SALLOW HER DARK HAIR WAS ELABORATELY DRESSED SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN OF THE THREE WHOSE FACE WAS FREE OF MAKE UP AND BY CONTRAST WITH THE OTHERS SHE SEEMED SIMPLE AND UNAFFECTED,13.9
36-16603-0016,THE DINING ROOM WAS IN THE GOOD TASTE OF THE PERIOD IT WAS VERY SEVERE,4.97
36-16603-0017,THE GREEN CURTAINS WITH THEIR PEACOCK DESIGN HUNG IN STRAIGHT LINES AND THE GREEN CARPET,5.525
36-16603-0018,LEAFY TREES SUGGESTED THE INFLUENCE OF WILLIAM MORRIS THERE WAS BLUE DELFT ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AT THAT TIME THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIVE HUNDRED DINING ROOMS IN LONDON DECORATED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER IT WAS CHASTE ARTISTIC,15.895
36-16603-0019,AND DULL WHEN WE LEFT I WALKED AWAY WITH MISS WATERFORD AND THE FINE DAY AND HER NEW HAT PERSUADED US TO SAUNTER THROUGH THE PARK,9.61
36-16603-0020,DID YOU THINK THE FOOD WAS GOOD I TOLD HER THAT IF SHE WANTED WRITERS SHE MUST FEED THEM WELL ADMIRABLE ADVICE I ANSWERED BUT WHY DOES SHE WANT THEM MISS WATERFORD SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS SHE FINDS THEM AMUSING,15.555
36-16603-0021,SHE WANTS TO BE IN THE MOVEMENT I FANCY SHE'S RATHER SIMPLE POOR DEAR AND SHE THINKS WE'RE ALL WONDERFUL AFTER ALL IT PLEASES HER TO ASK US TO LUNCHEON AND IT DOESN'T HURT US I LIKE HER FOR IT,13.725
36-16603-0022,SHE HAD LED A VERY QUIET YOUTH IN THE COUNTRY AND THE BOOKS THAT CAME DOWN FROM MUDIE'S LIBRARY BROUGHT WITH THEM NOT ONLY THEIR OWN ROMANCE BUT THE ROMANCE OF LONDON SHE HAD A REAL PASSION FOR READING RARE IN HER KIND,15.23
36-16603-0023,WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE AUTHOR THAN IN HIS BOOK IN THE PAINTER THAN IN HIS PICTURES AND SHE INVENTED A WORLD OF THE IMAGINATION IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH A FREEDOM SHE NEVER ACQUIRED IN THE WORLD OF EVERY DAY,15.395
36-16603-0024,WHEN SHE CAME TO KNOW WRITERS IT WAS LIKE ADVENTURING UPON A STAGE WHICH TILL THEN,7.155
36-16603-0025,SHE SAW THEM DRAMATICALLY AND REALLY SEEMED HERSELF TO LIVE A LARGER LIFE BECAUSE SHE ENTERTAINED THEM,6.64
36-16603-0026,NEVER FOR A MOMENT THOUGHT OF REGULATING HER OWN CONDUCT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM THEIR MORAL ECCENTRICITIES LIKE THEIR ODDITIES OF DRESS THEIR WILD THEORIES AND PARADOXES WERE AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH AMUSED HER,13.14
36-16603-0027,BUT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INFLUENCE ON HER CONVICTIONS IS THERE A MISTER STRICKLAND I ASKED OH YES HE'S SOMETHING IN THE CITY I BELIEVE HE'S A STOCKBROKER HE'S VERY DULL ARE THEY GOOD FRIENDS,15.67
36-16603-0028,BUT SHE DOESN'T OFTEN HAVE PEOPLE TO DINNER HE'S VERY QUIET HE'S NOT IN THE LEAST INTERESTED IN LITERATURE OR THE ARTS WHY DO NICE WOMEN MARRY DULL MEN BECAUSE INTELLIGENT MEN WON'T MARRY NICE WOMEN,16.45
36-16603-0029,I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY RETORT TO THIS SO I ASKED IF MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD CHILDREN YES SHE HAS A BOY AND A GIRL THEY'RE BOTH AT SCHOOL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED AND WE BEGAN TO TALK OF OTHER THINGS,15.92
36-16603-0030,DURING THE SUMMER I MET MISSUS STRICKLAND NOT INFREQUENTLY I WENT NOW AND THEN TO PLEASANT LITTLE LUNCHEONS AT HER FLAT AND TO RATHER MORE FORMIDABLE TEA PARTIES WE TOOK A FANCY TO ONE ANOTHER,12.535
36-16603-0031,I WAS VERY YOUNG AND PERHAPS SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF GUIDING MY VIRGIN STEPS ON THE HARD ROAD OF LETTERS WHILE FOR ME IT WAS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMEONE I COULD GO TO WITH MY SMALL TROUBLES CERTAIN OF AN ATTENTIVE EAR AND REASONABLE COUNSEL,15.78
36-16603-0032,MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD THE GIFT OF SYMPATHY IT IS A CHARMING FACULTY BUT ONE OFTEN ABUSED BY THOSE WHO ARE CONSCIOUS OF ITS POSSESSION FOR THERE IS SOMETHING GHOULISH IN THE AVIDITY WITH WHICH THEY WILL POUNCE UPON THE MISFORTUNE OF THEIR FRIENDS,14.91
36-16603-0033,SO THAT THEY MAY EXERCISE THEIR DEXTERITY IT GUSHES FORTH LIKE AN OIL WELL AND THE SYMPATHETIC POUR OUT THEIR SYMPATHY WITH AN ABANDON THAT IS SOMETIMES EMBARRASSING TO THEIR VICTIMS,12.115
36-16603-0034,MISSUS STRICKLAND USED HER ADVANTAGE WITH TACT YOU FELT THAT YOU OBLIGED HER BY ACCEPTING HER SYMPATHY WHEN IN THE ENTHUSIASM OF MY YOUTH I REMARKED ON THIS TO ROSE WATERFORD SHE SAID,13.675
36-16603-0035,ROSE WATERFORD HAD A BLISTERING TONGUE NO ONE COULD SAY SUCH BITTER THINGS ON THE OTHER HAND NO ONE COULD DO MORE CHARMING ONES THERE WAS ANOTHER THING I LIKED IN MISSUS STRICKLAND,12.905
36-16603-0036,SHE MANAGED HER SURROUNDINGS WITH ELEGANCE HER FLAT WAS ALWAYS NEAT AND CHEERFUL GAY WITH FLOWERS AND THE CHINTZES IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR SEVERE DESIGN WERE BRIGHT AND PRETTY THE MEALS IN THE ARTISTIC LITTLE DINING ROOM WERE PLEASANT,15.825
36-16603-0037,IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO SEE THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND WAS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER AND YOU FELT SURE THAT SHE WAS AN ADMIRABLE MOTHER THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE DRAWING ROOM OF HER SON AND DAUGHTER THE SON HIS NAME WAS ROBERT,14.875
36-16603-0038,WAS A BOY OF SIXTEEN AT RUGBY,2.37
36-16603-0039,HE HAD HIS MOTHER'S CANDID BROW AND FINE REFLECTIVE EYES HE LOOKED CLEAN HEALTHY AND NORMAL I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S VERY CLEVER SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPH BUT I KNOW HE'S GOOD HE HAS A CHARMING CHARACTER,16.635
36-16603-0040,THE DAUGHTER WAS FOURTEEN HER HAIR THICK AND DARK LIKE HER MOTHER'S FELL OVER HER SHOULDERS IN FINE PROFUSION AND SHE HAD THE SAME KINDLY EXPRESSION AND SEDATE UNTROUBLED EYES,13.74
36-16603-0041,THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM THE IMAGE OF YOU I SAID YES I THINK THEY ARE MORE LIKE ME THAN THEIR FATHER WHY HAVE YOU NEVER LET ME MEET HIM I ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE TO,12.34
36-16603-0042,PERHAPS HER NAIVETE WAS HER GREATEST CHARM YOU KNOW HE'S NOT AT ALL LITERARY SHE SAID HE'S A PERFECT PHILISTINE,9.445
36-16603-0043,SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE ASPERSIONS OF HER FRIENDS HE'S ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND HE'S A TYPICAL BROKER I THINK HE'D BORE YOU TO DEATH DOES HE BORE YOU I ASKED YOU SEE I HAPPEN TO BE HIS WIFE,15.165
36-16603-0044,I'M VERY FOND OF HIM SHE SMILED TO COVER HER SHYNESS AND I FANCIED SHE HAD A FEAR THAT I WOULD MAKE THE SORT OF GIBE THAT SUCH A CONFESSION COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO ELICIT FROM ROSE WATERFORD,14.4
36-16603-0045,SHE HESITATED A LITTLE HER EYES GREW TENDER HE DOESN'T PRETEND TO BE A GENIUS HE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE MUCH MONEY ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE BUT HE'S AWFULLY GOOD AND KIND,14.565
36-16603-0046,I THINK I SHOULD LIKE HIM VERY MUCH I'LL ASK YOU TO DINE WITH US QUIETLY SOME TIME BUT MIND YOU COME AT YOUR OWN RISK DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU HAVE A VERY DULL EVENING,12.49
36-16603-0047,BUT WHEN AT LAST I MET CHARLES STRICKLAND IT WAS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ALLOWED ME TO DO NO MORE THAN JUST MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE ONE MORNING MISSUS STRICKLAND SENT ME ROUND A NOTE TO SAY THAT SHE WAS GIVING A DINNER PARTY THAT EVENING,14.705
36-16603-0048,AND ONE OF HER GUESTS HAD FAILED HER SHE ASKED ME TO STOP THE GAP SHE WROTE IT'S ONLY DECENT TO WARN YOU THAT YOU WILL BE BORED TO EXTINCTION IT WAS A THOROUGHLY DULL PARTY FROM THE BEGINNING BUT,13.14
36-16603-0049,IF YOU WILL COME I SHALL BE UNCOMMONLY GRATEFUL AND YOU AND I CAN HAVE A LITTLE CHAT BY OURSELVES IT WAS ONLY NEIGHBOURLY TO ACCEPT WHEN MISSUS STRICKLAND INTRODUCED ME TO HER HUSBAND HE GAVE ME A RATHER INDIFFERENT HAND TO SHAKE,15.27
36-16603-0050,TURNING TO HIM GAILY SHE ATTEMPTED A SMALL JEST I ASKED HIM TO SHOW HIM THAT I REALLY HAD A HUSBAND I THINK HE WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT IT,9.93
36-16603-0051,STRICKLAND GAVE THE POLITE LITTLE LAUGH WITH WHICH PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE A FACETIOUSNESS IN WHICH THEY SEE NOTHING FUNNY BUT DID NOT SPEAK NEW ARRIVALS CLAIMED MY HOST'S ATTENTION AND I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF,13.165
36-16603-0052,WHEN AT LAST WE WERE ALL ASSEMBLED WAITING FOR DINNER TO BE ANNOUNCED I REFLECTED WHILE I CHATTED WITH THE WOMAN I HAD BEEN ASKED TO TAKE IN THAT CIVILISED MAN PRACTISES A STRANGE INGENUITY,12.895
36-16603-0053,IN WASTING ON TEDIOUS EXERCISES THE BRIEF SPAN OF HIS LIFE IT WAS THE KIND OF PARTY WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER WHY THE HOSTESS HAS TROUBLED TO BID HER GUESTS AND WHY THE GUESTS HAVE TROUBLED TO COME,13.985
36-16603-0054,THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE THEY MET WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WOULD PART WITH RELIEF IT WAS OF COURSE A PURELY SOCIAL FUNCTION THE STRICKLANDS OWED DINNERS TO A NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOM THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN AND SO HAD ASKED THEM,14.765
36-16603-0055,THESE PERSONS HAD ACCEPTED WHY TO AVOID THE TEDIUM OF DINING TETE A TETE TO GIVE THEIR SERVANTS A REST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO REASON TO REFUSE BECAUSE THEY WERE OWED A DINNER,12.485
36-16603-0056,THE DINING ROOM WAS INCONVENIENTLY CROWDED THERE WAS A K C AND HIS WIFE A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND HIS WIFE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S SISTER AND HER HUSBAND COLONEL MAC ANDREW AND THE WIFE OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT,14.71
36-16603-0057,IT WAS BECAUSE THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THAT I HAD BEEN INVITED THE RESPECTABILITY OF THE PARTY WAS PORTENTOUS THE WOMEN WERE TOO NICE TO BE WELL DRESSED AND TOO SURE OF THEIR POSITION TO BE AMUSING,15.6
36-16603-0058,THE MEN WERE SOLID THERE WAS ABOUT ALL OF THEM AN AIR OF WELL SATISFIED PROSPERITY EVERYONE TALKED A LITTLE LOUDER THAN NATURAL IN AN INSTINCTIVE DESIRE TO MAKE THE PARTY GO AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE IN THE ROOM,15.525
36-16603-0059,BUT THERE WAS NO GENERAL CONVERSATION EACH ONE TALKED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE RIGHT DURING THE SOUP FISH AND ENTREE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR ON THE LEFT DURING THE ROAST SWEET AND SAVOURY,12.715
36-16603-0060,THEY TALKED OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND OF GOLF OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THE LATEST PLAY OF THE PICTURES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF THE WEATHER AND THEIR PLANS FOR THE HOLIDAYS,11.205
36-16603-0061,PERHAPS HE DID NOT TALK VERY MUCH AND I FANCIED THERE WAS TOWARDS THE END A LOOK OF FATIGUE IN THE FACES OF THE WOMEN ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THEY WERE FINDING HIM HEAVY,11.24
36-16603-0062,ONCE OR TWICE MISSUS STRICKLAND'S EYES RESTED ON HIM SOMEWHAT ANXIOUSLY AT LAST SHE ROSE AND SHEPHERDED THE LADIES OUT OF ONE ROOM,10.28
36-16603-0063,STRICKLAND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND MOVING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE TOOK HIS PLACE BETWEEN THE K C AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL HE PASSED ROUND THE PORT AGAIN AND HANDED US CIGARS THE K C REMARKED ON THE EXCELLENCE OF THE WINE AND STRICKLAND TOLD US WHERE HE GOT IT,16.33
36-16603-0064,WE BEGAN TO CHAT ABOUT VINTAGES AND TOBACCO THE K C TOLD US OF A CASE HE WAS ENGAGED IN AND THE COLONEL TALKED ABOUT POLO I HAD NOTHING TO SAY AND SO SAT SILENT TRYING POLITELY TO SHOW INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION,15.6349375
36-16603-0065,AND BECAUSE I THOUGHT NO ONE WAS IN THE LEAST CONCERNED WITH ME EXAMINED STRICKLAND AT MY EASE HE WAS BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAD IMAGINED HIM SLENDER AND OF INSIGNIFICANT APPEARANCE,13.655
36-16603-0066,IN POINT OF FACT HE WAS BROAD AND HEAVY WITH LARGE HANDS AND FEET AND HE WORE HIS EVENING CLOTHES CLUMSILY HE GAVE YOU SOMEWHAT THE IDEA OF A COACHMAN DRESSED UP FOR THE OCCASION HE WAS A MAN OF FORTY,12.5950625
36-16603-0067,NOT GOOD LOOKING AND YET NOT UGLY FOR HIS FEATURES WERE RATHER GOOD,4.67
36-16603-0068,AND THE EFFECT WAS UNGAINLY HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS LARGE FACE LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLY NAKED HIS HAIR WAS REDDISH CUT VERY SHORT AND HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLUE OR GREY HE LOOKED COMMONPLACE,15.57
36-16603-0069,I NO LONGER WONDERED THAT MISSUS STRICKLAND FELT A CERTAIN EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT HIM HE WAS SCARCELY A CREDIT TO A WOMAN WHO WANTED TO MAKE HERSELF A POSITION IN THE WORLD OF ART AND LETTERS IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD NO SOCIAL GIFTS BUT,14.51
36-16603-0070,THESE A MAN CAN DO WITHOUT HE HAD NO ECCENTRICITY EVEN,4.245
37-214-0000,WAS AN EVIL WHICH NOTHING COULD COUNTERBALANCE HER WHOLE HAPPINESS SEEMED AT STAKE WHILE THE AFFAIR WAS IN SUSPENSE,7.53
37-214-0001,WHAT THIS ADDITIONAL FORTNIGHT,2.655
37-214-0002,MADE BUT A SMALL PART OF CATHERINE'S SPECULATION ONCE OR TWICE INDEED SINCE JAMES'S ENGAGEMENT HAD TAUGHT HER WHAT COULD BE DONE SHE HAD GOT SO FAR AS TO INDULGE IN A SECRET PERHAPS,13.43
37-214-0003,IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WHICH SAW THIS BUSINESS ARRANGED SHE VISITED MISS TILNEY AND POURED FORTH HER JOYFUL FEELINGS IT WAS DOOMED TO BE A DAY OF TRIAL NO SOONER HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER DELIGHT IN MISTER ALLEN'S LENGTHENED STAY,15.815
37-214-0004,THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT,15.095
37-214-0005,CATHERINE'S COUNTENANCE FELL AND IN A VOICE OF MOST SINCERE CONCERN SHE ECHOED MISS TILNEY'S CONCLUDING WORDS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK,9.865
37-214-0006,PERHAPS SAID MISS TILNEY IN AN EMBARRASSED MANNER YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY IF THE ENTRANCE OF HER FATHER PUT A STOP TO THE CIVILITY,11.12
37-214-0007,WHICH CATHERINE WAS BEGINNING TO HOPE MIGHT INTRODUCE A DESIRE OF THEIR CORRESPONDING AFTER ADDRESSING HER WITH HIS USUAL POLITENESS HE TURNED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND SAID WELL ELEANOR,11.88

37-214-0012,I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO MAKE THE REQUEST THOUGH,3.605
37-214-0013,THAN YOURSELF MODESTY SUCH AS YOURS BUT NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD I PAIN IT BY OPEN PRAISE IF YOU CAN BE INDUCED TO HONOUR US WITH A VISIT YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY BEYOND EXPRESSION TIS TRUE,13.385

37-214-0015,YET NO ENDEAVOURS SHALL BE WANTING ON OUR SIDE TO MAKE NORTHANGER ABBEY NOT WHOLLY DISAGREEABLE NORTHANGER ABBEY THESE WERE THRILLING WORDS AND WOUND UP CATHERINE'S FEELINGS TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF ECSTASY,14.29
37-214-0016,HER GRATEFUL AND GRATIFIED HEART COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN ITS EXPRESSIONS WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF TOLERABLE CALMNESS TO RECEIVE SO FLATTERING AN INVITATION TO HAVE HER COMPANY SO WARMLY SOLICITED,14.475
37-214-0017,EVERYTHING HONOURABLE AND SOOTHING EVERY PRESENT ENJOYMENT AND EVERY FUTURE HOPE WAS CONTAINED IN IT,6.58
37-214-0018,AND MAMMA'S APPROBATION WAS EAGERLY GIVEN,3.415
37-214-0019,GENERAL TILNEY WAS NOT LESS SANGUINE HAVING ALREADY WAITED ON HER EXCELLENT FRIENDS IN PULTENEY STREET AND OBTAINED THEIR SANCTION OF HIS WISHES SINCE THEY CAN CONSENT TO PART WITH YOU SAID HE,13.18
37-214-0020,WE MAY EXPECT PHILOSOPHY FROM ALL THE WORLD MISS TILNEY WAS EARNEST THOUGH GENTLE IN HER SECONDARY CIVILITIES AND THE AFFAIR BECAME IN A FEW MINUTES AS NEARLY SETTLED AS THIS NECESSARY REFERENCE TO FULLERTON WOULD ALLOW,14.195
37-214-0021,THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD LED CATHERINE'S FEELINGS THROUGH THE VARIETIES OF SUSPENSE SECURITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THEY WERE NOW SAFELY LODGED IN PERFECT BLISS AND WITH SPIRITS ELATED TO RAPTURE WITH HENRY AT HER HEART,14.57
37-214-0022,IN FRIENDS AND FORTUNE CIRCUMSTANCE AND CHANCE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO COOPERATE FOR HER ADVANTAGE BY THE KINDNESS OF HER FIRST FRIENDS THE ALLENS SHE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED INTO SCENES WHERE PLEASURES OF EVERY KIND HAD MET HER,14.575
37-214-0023,HER FEELINGS HER PREFERENCES HAD EACH KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF A RETURN WHEREVER SHE FELT ATTACHMENT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IT THE AFFECTION OF ISABELLA WAS TO BE SECURED TO HER IN A SISTER THE TILNEYS,14.06
37-214-0024,THEY BY WHOM ABOVE ALL SHE DESIRED TO BE FAVOURABLY THOUGHT OF OUTSTRIPPED EVEN HER WISHES IN THE FLATTERING MEASURES BY WHICH THEIR INTIMACY WAS TO BE CONTINUED SHE WAS TO BE THEIR CHOSEN VISITOR,12.315
37-214-0025,AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST THIS ROOF WAS TO BE THE ROOF OF AN ABBEY HER PASSION FOR ANCIENT EDIFICES WAS NEXT IN DEGREE TO HER PASSION FOR HENRY TILNEY,10.45
37-214-0026,AND CASTLES AND ABBEYS MADE USUALLY THE CHARM OF THOSE REVERIES WHICH HIS IMAGE DID NOT FILL TO SEE AND EXPLORE EITHER THE RAMPARTS AND KEEP OF THE ONE OR THE CLOISTERS OF THE OTHER HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS A DARLING WISH,14.265
37-214-0027,WITH ALL THE CHANCES AGAINST HER OF HOUSE HALL PLACE PARK COURT AND COTTAGE NORTHANGER TURNED UP AN ABBEY AND SHE WAS TO BE ITS INHABITANT ITS LONG DAMP PASSAGES ITS NARROW CELLS,14.335
37-214-0028,THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT SHOULD BE SO MEEKLY BORNE THE POWER OF EARLY HABIT ONLY COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT A DISTINCTION TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN GAVE NO PRIDE THEIR SUPERIORITY OF ABODE WAS NO MORE TO THEM THAN THEIR SUPERIORITY OF PERSON,15.555
37-214-0029,MANY WERE THE INQUIRIES SHE WAS EAGER TO MAKE OF MISS TILNEY BUT SO ACTIVE WERE HER THOUGHTS THAT WHEN THESE INQUIRIES WERE ANSWERED SHE WAS HARDLY MORE ASSURED THAN BEFORE,10.13
37-214-0030,OF NORTHANGER ABBEY HAVING BEEN A RICHLY ENDOWED CONVENT AT THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION OF ITS HAVING FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF AN ANCESTOR OF THE TILNEYS ON ITS DISSOLUTION,12.045
37-215-0000,WITH A MIND THUS FULL OF HAPPINESS CATHERINE WAS HARDLY AWARE THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS HAD PASSED AWAY WITHOUT HER SEEING ISABELLA FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER SHE BEGAN FIRST TO BE SENSIBLE OF THIS AND TO SIGH FOR HER CONVERSATION,14.335
37-215-0001,AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PUMP ROOM ONE MORNING BY MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR AND SCARCELY HAD SHE FELT A FIVE MINUTES LONGING OF FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE OBJECT OF IT APPEARED,12.26
37-215-0002,WHICH COMMANDED A TOLERABLE VIEW OF EVERYBODY ENTERING AT EITHER IT IS SO OUT OF THE WAY CATHERINE OBSERVING THAT ISABELLA'S EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BENT TOWARDS ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER AS IN EAGER EXPECTATION AND REMEMBERING HOW OFTEN,15.76
37-215-0003,SHE HAD BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING ARCH THOUGHT THE PRESENT A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING REALLY SO AND THEREFORE GAILY SAID DO NOT BE UNEASY ISABELLA JAMES WILL SOON BE HERE PSHA MY DEAR CREATURE SHE REPLIED DO NOT THINK,15.43
37-215-0004,ME SUCH A SIMPLETON AS TO BE ALWAYS WANTING TO CONFINE HIM TO MY ELBOW IT WOULD BE HIDEOUS TO BE ALWAYS TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE THE JEST OF THE PLACE AND SO YOU ARE GOING TO NORTHANGER I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD OF IT,14.795
37-215-0005,IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST OLD PLACES IN ENGLAND I UNDERSTAND I SHALL DEPEND UPON A MOST PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF IT YOU SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE THE BEST IN MY POWER TO GIVE BUT WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ARE YOUR SISTERS COMING,13.88
37-215-0006,TILNEY SAYS IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH MINDS OF A CERTAIN STAMP BUT I THOUGHT ISABELLA YOU HAD SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR TO TELL ME OH YES AND SO I HAVE BUT HERE IS A PROOF OF WHAT I WAS SAYING,13.655
37-215-0007,MY POOR HEAD I HAD QUITE FORGOT IT WELL THE THING IS THIS I HAVE JUST HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN YOU CAN GUESS THE CONTENTS NO INDEED I CANNOT MY SWEET LOVE,11.17
37-215-0008,WHAT CAN HE WRITE ABOUT BUT YOURSELF YOU KNOW HE IS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH YOU WITH ME DEAR ISABELLA NAY MY SWEETEST CATHERINE THIS IS BEING QUITE ABSURD,11.4
37-215-0009,MODESTY AND ALL THAT IS VERY WELL IN ITS WAY BUT REALLY A LITTLE COMMON HONESTY IS SOMETIMES QUITE AS BECOMING I HAVE NO IDEA OF BEING SO OVERSTRAINED IT IS FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS HIS ATTENTIONS WERE SUCH AS A CHILD MUST HAVE NOTICED,14.415
37-215-0010,AND IT WAS BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE LEFT BATH THAT YOU GAVE HIM THE MOST POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT HE SAYS SO IN THIS LETTER SAYS THAT HE AS GOOD AS MADE YOU AN OFFER,9.325
37-215-0011,SO IT IS IN VAIN TO AFFECT IGNORANCE,3.335
37-215-0012,PROTESTING HER INNOCENCE OF EVERY THOUGHT OF MISTER THORPE'S BEING IN LOVE WITH HER AND THE CONSEQUENT IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER HAVING EVER INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIM,9.275
37-215-0013,AS TO ANY ATTENTIONS ON HIS SIDE I DO DECLARE UPON MY HONOUR I NEVER WAS SENSIBLE OF THEM FOR A MOMENT EXCEPT JUST HIS ASKING ME TO DANCE THE FIRST DAY OF HIS COMING,12.105
37-215-0014,I COULD NOT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD A THING OF THAT KIND YOU KNOW,3.545
37-215-0015,WELL IF YOU SAY IT IT WAS SO I DARE SAY BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT RECOLLECT IT I DO REMEMBER NOW BEING WITH YOU AND SEEING HIM AS WELL AS THE REST BUT THAT WE WERE,11.805
37-215-0016,HOWEVER IT IS NOT WORTH ARGUING ABOUT FOR WHATEVER MIGHT PASS ON HIS SIDE YOU MUST BE CONVINCED BY MY HAVING NO RECOLLECTION OF IT THAT I NEVER THOUGHT NOR EXPECTED NOR WISHED FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND FROM HIM,13.41
37-215-0017,I AM EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ANY REGARD FOR ME BUT INDEED IT HAS BEEN QUITE UNINTENTIONAL ON MY SIDE I NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF IT PRAY UNDECEIVE HIM AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND TELL HIM I BEG HIS PARDON THAT IS,15.555
37-215-0018,I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN IN THE PROPEREST WAY I WOULD NOT SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF A BROTHER OF YOURS ISABELLA I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT IF I COULD THINK OF ONE MAN MORE THAN ANOTHER,14.99
37-215-0019,ISABELLA WAS SILENT MY DEAR FRIEND YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME I CANNOT SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER CARES SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ME AND YOU KNOW WE SHALL STILL BE SISTERS,11.42
37-215-0020,WELL MY DEAR CATHERINE THE CASE SEEMS TO BE THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED AGAINST POOR JOHN IS NOT IT SO,6.285
37-215-0021,SINCE THAT IS THE CASE I AM SURE I SHALL NOT TEASE YOU ANY FURTHER,4.04
37-215-0022,BUT I CONFESS AS SOON AS I READ HIS LETTER I THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH IMPRUDENT BUSINESS AND NOT LIKELY TO PROMOTE THE GOOD OF EITHER FOR WHAT WERE YOU TO LIVE UPON SUPPOSING YOU CAME TOGETHER YOU HAVE BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING TO BE SURE,13.52
37-215-0023,BUT IT IS NOT A TRIFLE THAT WILL SUPPORT A FAMILY NOWADAYS AND AFTER ALL THAT ROMANCERS MAY SAY THERE IS NO DOING WITHOUT MONEY I ONLY WONDER JOHN COULD THINK OF IT HE COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED MY LAST YOU DO ACQUIT ME THEN OF ANYTHING WRONG,15.52
37-215-0024,YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT I NEVER MEANT TO DECEIVE YOUR BROTHER NEVER SUSPECTED HIM OF LIKING ME TILL THIS MOMENT OH AS TO THAT ANSWERED ISABELLA LAUGHINGLY,10.145
37-215-0025,MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAN ONE WISHES TO STAND BY BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I AM THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO JUDGE YOU SEVERELY ALL THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE ALLOWED FOR IN YOUTH AND HIGH SPIRITS WHAT ONE MEANS ONE DAY YOU KNOW ONE MAY NOT MEAN THE NEXT,14.275
37-215-0026,CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE OPINIONS ALTER BUT MY OPINION OF YOUR BROTHER NEVER DID ALTER IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT NEVER HAPPENED MY DEAREST CATHERINE CONTINUED THE OTHER WITHOUT AT ALL LISTENING TO HER,14.815
37-215-0027,I WOULD NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD BE THE MEANS OF HURRYING YOU INTO AN ENGAGEMENT BEFORE YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT I DO NOT THINK ANYTHING WOULD JUSTIFY ME IN WISHING YOU TO SACRIFICE ALL YOUR HAPPINESS MERELY TO OBLIGE MY BROTHER,14.31
37-215-0028,BECAUSE HE IS MY BROTHER AND WHO PERHAPS AFTER ALL YOU KNOW MIGHT BE JUST AS HAPPY WITHOUT YOU FOR PEOPLE SELDOM KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE AT YOUNG MEN ESPECIALLY THEY ARE SO AMAZINGLY CHANGEABLE AND INCONSTANT,13.735
37-215-0029,WHAT I SAY IS WHY SHOULD A BROTHER'S HAPPINESS BE DEARER TO ME THAN A FRIEND'S YOU KNOW I CARRY MY NOTIONS OF FRIENDSHIP PRETTY HIGH,7.99
37-215-0030,TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT IF YOU ARE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YOU WILL CERTAINLY LIVE TO REPENT IT,5.69
37-215-0031,AH HERE HE COMES NEVER MIND HE WILL NOT SEE US I AM SURE CATHERINE LOOKING UP PERCEIVED CAPTAIN TILNEY AND ISABELLA EARNESTLY FIXING HER EYE ON HIM AS SHE SPOKE SOON CAUGHT HIS NOTICE,13.91
37-215-0032,HE APPROACHED IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK THE SEAT TO WHICH HER MOVEMENTS INVITED HIM HIS FIRST ADDRESS MADE CATHERINE START THOUGH SPOKEN LOW SHE COULD DISTINGUISH WHAT,11.58
37-215-0033,PSHA NONSENSE WAS ISABELLA'S ANSWER IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER WHY DO YOU PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY HEAD IF I COULD BELIEVE IT MY SPIRIT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY INDEPENDENT,12.15
37-215-0034,THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME MY HEART INDEED WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO DO WITH HEARTS YOU MEN HAVE NONE OF YOU ANY HEARTS IF WE HAVE NOT HEARTS WE HAVE EYES AND THEY GIVE US TORMENT ENOUGH,13.24
37-215-0035,SHE ROSE UP AND SAYING SHE SHOULD JOIN MISSUS ALLEN PROPOSED THEIR WALKING BUT FOR THIS ISABELLA SHOWED NO INCLINATION SHE WAS SO AMAZINGLY TIRED AND IT WAS SO ODIOUS TO PARADE ABOUT THE PUMP ROOM AND IF SHE MOVED FROM HER SEAT SHE SHOULD MISS HER SISTERS,15.995
37-215-0036,SHE WAS EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST EXCUSE HER AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN BUT CATHERINE COULD BE STUBBORN TOO AND MISSUS ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR RETURNING HOME,13.54
37-215-0037,WITH MUCH UNEASINESS DID SHE THUS LEAVE THEM IT SEEMED TO HER THAT CAPTAIN TILNEY WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH ISABELLA AND ISABELLA UNCONSCIOUSLY ENCOURAGING HIM,10.11
37-215-0038,SHE WISHED ISABELLA HAD TALKED MORE LIKE HER USUAL SELF AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND HAD NOT LOOKED SO WELL PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN TILNEY HOW STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE HIS ADMIRATION,12.25
37-215-0039,THE COMPLIMENT OF JOHN THORPE'S AFFECTION DID NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR THIS THOUGHTLESSNESS IN HIS SISTER SHE WAS ALMOST AS FAR FROM BELIEVING AS FROM WISHING IT TO BE SINCERE FOR SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT HE COULD MISTAKE,13.825
37-215-0040,AND HIS ASSERTION OF THE OFFER AND OF HER ENCOURAGEMENT CONVINCED HER THAT HIS MISTAKES COULD SOMETIMES BE VERY EGREGIOUS IN VANITY THEREFORE,10.04
37-215-0041,HER CHIEF PROFIT WAS IN WONDER THAT HE SHOULD THINK IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO FANCY HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER WAS A MATTER OF LIVELY ASTONISHMENT,7.68
37-225-0000,HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN THE HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY EVERY LAUGH INDULGED,13.51
37-225-0001,RESTRAINT WHICH THE GENERAL'S PRESENCE HAD IMPOSED AND MOST THANKFULLY FEEL THEIR PRESENT RELEASE FROM IT SUCH EASE AND SUCH DELIGHTS MADE HER LOVE THE PLACE AND THE PEOPLE MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY,12.355
37-225-0002,AND AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER SHE WOULD AT EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WAS NOW IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME,13.095
37-225-0003,THE FOURTH WEEK WOULD BE TURNED AND PERHAPS IT MIGHT SEEM AN INTRUSION IF SHE STAYED MUCH LONGER THIS WAS A PAINFUL CONSIDERATION WHENEVER IT OCCURRED AND EAGER TO GET RID OF SUCH A WEIGHT ON HER MIND SHE VERY SOON RESOLVED TO SPEAK TO ELEANOR ABOUT IT AT ONCE,15.335
37-225-0004,PROPOSE GOING AWAY AND BE GUIDED IN HER CONDUCT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HER PROPOSAL MIGHT BE TAKEN AWARE THAT IF SHE GAVE HERSELF MUCH TIME SHE MIGHT FEEL IT DIFFICULT TO BRING FORWARD SO UNPLEASANT A SUBJECT,13.41
37-225-0005,TO START FORTH HER OBLIGATION OF GOING AWAY VERY SOON ELEANOR LOOKED AND DECLARED HERSELF MUCH CONCERNED SHE HAD HOPED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME HAD BEEN MISLED PERHAPS BY HER WISHES,14.9450625
37-225-0006,AND COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT IF MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND WERE AWARE OF THE PLEASURE IT WAS TO HER TO HAVE HER THERE THEY WOULD BE TOO GENEROUS TO HASTEN HER RETURN CATHERINE EXPLAINED OH AS TO THAT,13.765
37-225-0007,PAPA AND MAMMA WERE IN NO HURRY AT ALL AS LONG AS SHE WAS HAPPY THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE SATISFIED THEN WHY MIGHT SHE ASK,9.23
37-225-0008,OH BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG NAY IF YOU CAN USE SUCH A WORD I CAN URGE YOU NO FARTHER IF YOU THINK IT LONG OH NO I DO NOT INDEED,10.725
37-225-0009,TILL SHE HAD HER LEAVING THEM WAS NOT EVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF IN HAVING THIS CAUSE OF UNEASINESS SO PLEASANTLY REMOVED THE FORCE OF THE OTHER WAS LIKEWISE WEAKENED THE KINDNESS THE EARNESTNESS OF ELEANOR'S MANNER IN PRESSING HER TO STAY,15.355
37-225-0010,AND HENRY'S GRATIFIED LOOK ON BEING TOLD THAT HER STAY WAS DETERMINED,4.67
37-225-0011,AS LEFT HER ONLY JUST SO MUCH SOLICITUDE AS THE HUMAN MIND CAN NEVER DO COMFORTABLY WITHOUT SHE DID ALMOST ALWAYS,8.52
37-225-0012,AND BELIEVING SO FAR HER DOUBTS AND ANXIETIES WERE MERELY SPORTIVE IRRITATIONS HENRY WAS NOT ABLE TO OBEY HIS FATHER'S INJUNCTION OF REMAINING WHOLLY AT NORTHANGER IN ATTENDANCE ON THE LADIES DURING HIS ABSENCE IN LONDON,14.71
37-225-0013,THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON SATURDAY,4.675
37-225-0014,HIS LOSS WAS NOT NOW WHAT IT HAD BEEN WHILE THE GENERAL WAS AT HOME,4.745
37-225-0015,BUT DID NOT RUIN THEIR COMFORT,2.065
37-225-0016,FOUND THEMSELVES SO WELL SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME TO THEMSELVES THAT IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK RATHER A LATE HOUR AT THE ABBEY BEFORE THEY QUITTED THE SUPPER ROOM ON THE DAY OF HENRY'S DEPARTURE THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS WHEN IT SEEMED,14.675
37-225-0017,AS FAR AS THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO JUDGE THAT A CARRIAGE WAS DRIVING UP TO THE DOOR AND THE NEXT MOMENT CONFIRMED THE IDEA BY THE LOUD NOISE OF THE HOUSE BELL AFTER THE FIRST PERTURBATION OF SURPRISE HAD PASSED AWAY,15.195
37-225-0018,IN A GOOD HEAVEN WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED BY ELEANOR TO BE HER ELDEST BROTHER WHOSE ARRIVAL WAS OFTEN AS SUDDEN IF NOT QUITE SO UNSEASONABLE AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HURRIED DOWN TO WELCOME HIM,13.72
37-225-0019,CATHERINE WALKED ON TO HER CHAMBER MAKING UP HER MIND AS WELL AS SHE COULD TO A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY AND COMFORTING HERSELF UNDER THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION HIS CONDUCT HAD GIVEN HER,12.205
37-225-0020,TO APPROVE OF HER THAT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD NOT MEET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS WOULD MAKE THEIR MEETING MATERIALLY PAINFUL SHE TRUSTED HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK OF MISS THORPE AND INDEED AS HE MUST BY THIS TIME BE ASHAMED OF THE PART HE HAD ACTED,16.385
37-225-0021,THERE COULD BE NO DANGER OF IT AND AS LONG AS ALL MENTION OF BATH SCENES WERE AVOIDED SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD BEHAVE TO HIM VERY CIVILLY IN SUCH CONSIDERATIONS TIME PASSED AWAY,11.535
37-225-0022,AT THAT MOMENT CATHERINE THOUGHT SHE HEARD HER STEP IN THE GALLERY AND LISTENED FOR ITS CONTINUANCE BUT ALL WAS SILENT SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD SHE CONVICTED HER FANCY OF ERROR WHEN THE NOISE OF SOMETHING MOVING CLOSE TO HER DOOR MADE HER START,15.655
37-225-0023,IT SEEMED AS IF SOMEONE WAS TOUCHING THE VERY DOORWAY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT A SLIGHT MOTION OF THE LOCK PROVED THAT SOME HAND MUST BE ON IT SHE TREMBLED A LITTLE AT THE IDEA OF ANYONE'S APPROACHING SO CAUTIOUSLY,13.99
37-225-0024,BUT RESOLVING NOT TO BE AGAIN OVERCOME BY TRIVIAL APPEARANCES OF ALARM OR MISLED BY A RAISED IMAGINATION SHE STEPPED QUIETLY FORWARD AND OPENED THE DOOR ELEANOR AND ONLY ELEANOR STOOD THERE,14.295
37-225-0025,CATHERINE'S SPIRITS HOWEVER WERE TRANQUILLIZED BUT FOR AN INSTANT,4.555
37-225-0026,THOUGH EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO COME IN,2.75
37-225-0027,AND A STILL GREATER TO SPEAK WHEN THERE CATHERINE SUPPOSING SOME UNEASINESS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ACCOUNT COULD ONLY EXPRESS HER CONCERN BY SILENT ATTENTION OBLIGED HER TO BE SEATED RUBBED HER TEMPLES WITH LAVENDER WATER,15.39
37-225-0028,AND HUNG OVER HER WITH AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT INDEED WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS I AM QUITE WELL THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME,15.395
37-225-0029,I CANNOT BEAR IT I COME TO YOU ON SUCH AN ERRAND ERRAND TO ME HOW SHALL I TELL YOU OH HOW SHALL I TELL YOU A NEW IDEA NOW DARTED INTO CATHERINE'S MIND,14.855
37-225-0030,AND TURNING AS PALE AS HER FRIEND SHE EXCLAIMED TIS A MESSENGER FROM WOODSTON YOU ARE MISTAKEN INDEED RETURNED ELEANOR LOOKING AT HER MOST COMPASSIONATELY IT IS NO ONE FROM WOODSTON IT IS MY FATHER HIMSELF,15.305
37-225-0031,HER VOICE FALTERED AND HER EYES WERE TURNED TO THE GROUND AS SHE MENTIONED HIS NAME HIS UNLOOKED FOR RETURN WAS ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO MAKE CATHERINE'S HEART SINK,9.88
37-225-0032,WORSE TO BE TOLD SHE SAID NOTHING AND ELEANOR ENDEAVOURING TO COLLECT HERSELF AND SPEAK WITH FIRMNESS BUT WITH EYES STILL CAST DOWN SOON WENT ON YOU ARE TOO GOOD I AM SURE,12.895
37-225-0033,TO THINK THE WORSE OF ME FOR THE PART I AM OBLIGED TO PERFORM I AM INDEED A MOST UNWILLING MESSENGER AFTER WHAT HAS SO LATELY PASSED SO LATELY BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN US HOW JOYFULLY HOW THANKFULLY ON MY SIDE,15.92
37-225-0034,AS TO YOUR CONTINUING HERE AS I HOPED FOR MANY MANY WEEKS LONGER HOW CAN I TELL YOU THAT YOUR KINDNESS IS NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AND THAT THE HAPPINESS YOUR COMPANY HAS HITHERTO GIVEN US IS TO BE REPAID BY,13.21
37-225-0035,BUT I MUST NOT TRUST MYSELF WITH WORDS MY DEAR CATHERINE WE ARE TO PART MY FATHER HAS RECOLLECTED AN ENGAGEMENT THAT TAKES OUR WHOLE FAMILY AWAY ON MONDAY WE ARE GOING TO LORD LONGTOWN'S NEAR HEREFORD FOR A FORTNIGHT,15.715
37-225-0036,MY DEAR ELEANOR CRIED CATHERINE SUPPRESSING HER FEELINGS AS WELL AS SHE COULD DO NOT BE SO DISTRESSED A SECOND ENGAGEMENT MUST GIVE WAY TO A FIRST,11.19

37-225-0040,BUT HOW CAN I TELL YOU TOMORROW MORNING IS FIXED FOR YOUR LEAVING US,6.31
37-225-0041,THE VERY CARRIAGE IS ORDERED AND WILL BE HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND NO SERVANT WILL BE OFFERED YOU CATHERINE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS AND SPEECHLESS I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY SENSES WHEN I HEARD IT,14.105
37-225-0042,EVEN OF DECENT CIVILITY DEAR DEAR CATHERINE IN BEING THE BEARER OF SUCH A MESSAGE I SEEM GUILTY MYSELF OF ALL ITS INSULT YET,9.995
37-225-0043,I TRUST YOU WILL ACQUIT ME FOR YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN THIS HOUSE TO SEE THAT I AM BUT A NOMINAL MISTRESS OF IT THAT MY REAL POWER IS NOTHING HAVE I OFFENDED THE GENERAL SAID CATHERINE IN A FALTERING VOICE,15.93
37-225-0044,ALL THAT I KNOW ALL THAT I ANSWER FOR IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE GIVEN HIM NO JUST CAUSE OF OFFENCE HE CERTAINLY IS GREATLY VERY GREATLY DISCOMPOSED I HAVE SELDOM SEEN HIM MORE SO HIS TEMPER IS NOT HAPPY,14.355
37-225-0045,I AM VERY SORRY IF I HAVE OFFENDED HIM IT WAS THE LAST THING I WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DONE BUT DO NOT BE UNHAPPY ELEANOR AN ENGAGEMENT YOU KNOW MUST BE KEPT I AM ONLY SORRY IT WAS NOT RECOLLECTED SOONER THAT I MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN HOME,15.545
37-225-0046,BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMFORT APPEARANCE PROPRIETY,15.135

37-225-0049,NOW LEFT HER WITH I SHALL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING CATHERINE'S SWELLING HEART NEEDED RELIEF IN ELEANOR'S PRESENCE FRIENDSHIP AND PRIDE HAD EQUALLY RESTRAINED HER TEARS BUT NO SOONER WAS SHE GONE THAN THEY BURST FORTH IN TORRENTS,15.835
37-225-0050,TURNED FROM THE HOUSE AND IN SUCH A WAY,3.12
37-225-0051,WHO COULD SAY WHEN THEY MIGHT MEET AGAIN AND ALL THIS BY SUCH A MAN AS GENERAL TILNEY SO POLITE SO WELL BRED AND HERETOFORE SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF HER IT WAS AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS IT WAS MORTIFYING AND GRIEVOUS,15.21
37-225-0052,FROM WHAT IT COULD ARISE AND WHERE IT WOULD END WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF EQUAL PERPLEXITY AND ALARM THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS DONE SO GROSSLY UNCIVIL HURRYING HER AWAY WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO HER OWN CONVENIENCE,13.15
37-225-0053,OR ALLOWING HER EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF CHOICE AS TO THE TIME OR MODE OF HER TRAVELLING OF TWO DAYS THE EARLIEST FIXED ON AND OF THAT ALMOST THE EARLIEST HOUR AS IF RESOLVED TO HAVE HER GONE BEFORE HE WAS STIRRING IN THE MORNING,13.995
37-225-0054,THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED EVEN TO SEE HER WHAT COULD ALL THIS MEAN BUT AN INTENTIONAL AFFRONT BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER SHE MUST HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO OFFEND HIM ELEANOR HAD WISHED TO SPARE HER FROM SO PAINFUL A NOTION,15.1
37-225-0055,BUT CATHERINE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY INJURY OR ANY MISFORTUNE COULD PROVOKE SUCH ILL WILL AGAINST A PERSON NOT CONNECTED OR AT LEAST,9.67
37-225-0056,HEAVILY PASSED THE NIGHT SLEEP OR REPOSE THAT DESERVED THE NAME OF SLEEP WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT ROOM IN WHICH HER DISTURBED IMAGINATION HAD TORMENTED HER ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL,13.245
37-225-0057,HER ANXIETY HAD FOUNDATION IN FACT HER FEARS IN PROBABILITY AND WITH A MIND SO OCCUPIED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF ACTUAL AND NATURAL EVIL THE SOLITUDE OF HER SITUATION THE DARKNESS OF HER CHAMBER THE ANTIQUITY OF THE BUILDING,15.835
37-225-0058,WERE FELT AND CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS HIGH AND OFTEN PRODUCED STRANGE AND SUDDEN NOISES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE SHE HEARD IT ALL AS SHE LAY AWAKE HOUR AFTER HOUR WITHOUT CURIOSITY OR TERROR,14.965
37-225-0059,SOON AFTER SIX ELEANOR ENTERED HER ROOM EAGER TO SHOW ATTENTION OR GIVE ASSISTANCE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT VERY LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE,9.295
37-225-0060,THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME CONCILIATORY MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL OCCURRED TO HER AS HIS DAUGHTER APPEARED,6.405
37-225-0061,AND SHE ONLY WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED AN APOLOGY MIGHT PROPERLY BE RECEIVED BY HER BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS HERE IT WAS NOT CALLED FOR,11.305
37-225-0062,ELEANOR BROUGHT NO MESSAGE VERY LITTLE PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON MEETING,5.365
37-225-0063,AND FEW AND TRIVIAL WERE THE SENTENCES EXCHANGED WHILE THEY REMAINED UPSTAIRS CATHERINE IN BUSY AGITATION COMPLETING HER DRESS AND ELEANOR WITH MORE GOODWILL THAN EXPERIENCE INTENT UPON FILLING THE TRUNK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THEY LEFT THE ROOM,15.915
37-225-0064,CATHERINE LINGERING ONLY HALF A MINUTE BEHIND HER FRIEND TO THROW A PARTING GLANCE ON EVERY WELL KNOWN CHERISHED OBJECT AND WENT DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE BREAKFAST WAS PREPARED,11.335
37-225-0065,SHE TRIED TO EAT AS WELL TO SAVE HERSELF FROM THE PAIN OF BEING URGED AS TO MAKE HER FRIEND COMFORTABLE BUT SHE HAD NO APPETITE AND COULD NOT SWALLOW MANY MOUTHFULS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS AND HER LAST BREAKFAST IN THAT ROOM GAVE HER FRESH MISERY,15.93
37-225-0066,AND STRENGTHENED HER DISTASTE FOR EVERYTHING BEFORE HER,3.44
37-225-0067,STRIKING AT THAT INSTANT ON HER MIND WITH PECULIAR FORCE,3.815
37-225-0068,ELEANOR SEEMED NOW IMPELLED INTO RESOLUTION AND SPEECH YOU MUST WRITE TO ME CATHERINE SHE CRIED YOU MUST LET ME HEAR FROM YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TILL I KNOW YOU TO BE SAFE AT HOME I SHALL NOT HAVE AN HOUR'S COMFORT,13.975
37-225-0069,FOR ONE LETTER AT ALL RISKS ALL HAZARDS I MUST ENTREAT,5.135
37-225-0070,AND THEN TILL I CAN ASK FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS I OUGHT TO DO I WILL NOT EXPECT MORE DIRECT TO ME AT LORD LONGTOWN'S AND I MUST ASK IT UNDER COVER TO ALICE NO ELEANOR,13.755
37-225-0071,I WILL TRUST TO YOUR OWN KINDNESS OF HEART WHEN I AM AT A DISTANCE FROM YOU BUT THIS WITH THE LOOK OF SORROW ACCOMPANYING IT WAS ENOUGH TO MELT CATHERINE'S PRIDE IN A MOMENT AND SHE INSTANTLY SAID OH ELEANOR I WILL WRITE TO YOU INDEED,16.57
37-225-0072,THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY AND UPON SUGGESTING IT TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION,16.055
37-225-0073,IT PROVED TO BE EXACTLY THE CASE CATHERINE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT TILL THAT MOMENT BUT UPON EXAMINING HER PURSE WAS CONVINCED THAT BUT FOR THIS KINDNESS OF HER FRIEND SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TURNED FROM THE HOUSE WITHOUT EVEN THE MEANS OF GETTING HOME,15.165
37-225-0074,AND THE DISTRESS IN WHICH SHE MUST HAVE BEEN THEREBY INVOLVED FILLING THE MINDS OF BOTH SCARCELY ANOTHER WORD WAS SAID BY EITHER DURING THE TIME OF THEIR REMAINING TOGETHER SHORT HOWEVER WAS THAT TIME THE CARRIAGE WAS SOON ANNOUNCED TO BE READY,14.845
37-225-0075,AND CATHERINE INSTANTLY RISING A LONG AND AFFECTIONATE EMBRACE SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF LANGUAGE IN BIDDING EACH OTHER ADIEU AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HALL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT SOME MENTION OF ONE WHOSE NAME HAD NOT YET BEEN SPOKEN BY EITHER,15.47
37-225-0076,SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS JUST MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT SHE LEFT HER KIND REMEMBRANCE FOR HER ABSENT FRIEND,9.35
44-201-0000,WITH MORE THAN USUAL EAGERNESS DID CATHERINE HASTEN TO THE PUMP ROOM THE NEXT DAY SECURE WITHIN HERSELF OF SEEING MISTER TILNEY THERE BEFORE THE MORNING WERE OVER AND READY TO MEET HIM WITH A SMILE BUT NO SMILE WAS DEMANDED,14.355
44-201-0001,MISTER TILNEY DID NOT APPEAR EVERY CREATURE IN BATH EXCEPT HIMSELF WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE FASHIONABLE HOURS,10.315
44-201-0002,UP THE STEPS AND DOWN PEOPLE WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT AND NOBODY WANTED TO SEE AND HE ONLY WAS ABSENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PLACE BATH IS SAID MISSUS ALLEN AS THEY SAT DOWN NEAR THE GREAT CLOCK,15.075
44-201-0003,AFTER PARADING THE ROOM TILL THEY WERE TIRED AND HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE IF WE HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE,7.66
44-201-0004,THIS SENTIMENT HAD BEEN UTTERED SO OFTEN IN VAIN THAT MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON TO HOPE IT WOULD BE FOLLOWED WITH MORE ADVANTAGE NOW BUT WE ARE TOLD TO DESPAIR OF NOTHING WE WOULD ATTAIN AS UNWEARIED,15.175
44-201-0005,DILIGENCE OUR POINT WOULD GAIN AND THE UNWEARIED DILIGENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD EVERY DAY WISHED FOR THE SAME THING WAS AT LENGTH TO HAVE ITS JUST REWARD FOR HARDLY HAD SHE BEEN SEATED TEN MINUTES,13.865
44-201-0006,BEFORE A LADY OF ABOUT HER OWN AGE WHO WAS SITTING BY HER AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER ATTENTIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ADDRESSED HER WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE IN THESE WORDS,11.59
44-201-0007,IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU BUT IS NOT YOUR NAME ALLEN THIS QUESTION ANSWERED AS IT READILY WAS THE STRANGER PRONOUNCED HERS TO BE THORPE,11.59
44-201-0008,AND MISSUS ALLEN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE FEATURES OF A FORMER SCHOOLFELLOW AND INTIMATE WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ONLY ONCE SINCE THEIR RESPECTIVE MARRIAGES AND THAT MANY YEARS AGO THEIR JOY ON THIS MEETING WAS VERY GREAT,15.19
44-201-0009,SINCE THEY HAD BEEN CONTENTED TO KNOW NOTHING OF EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS COMPLIMENTS ON GOOD LOOKS NOW PASSED AND AFTER OBSERVING HOW TIME HAD SLIPPED AWAY SINCE THEY WERE LAST TOGETHER,13.43
44-201-0010,HOW LITTLE THEY HAD THOUGHT OF MEETING IN BATH AND WHAT A PLEASURE IT WAS TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND THEY PROCEEDED TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND GIVE INTELLIGENCE AS TO THEIR FAMILIES SISTERS AND COUSINS TALKING BOTH TOGETHER,14.275
44-201-0011,FAR MORE READY TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND EACH HEARING VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID MISSUS THORPE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE AS A TALKER OVER MISSUS ALLEN IN A FAMILY OF CHILDREN,14.04
44-201-0012,AND WHEN SHE EXPATIATED ON THE TALENTS OF HER SONS AND THE BEAUTY OF HER DAUGHTERS WHEN SHE RELATED THEIR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND VIEWS THAT JOHN WAS AT OXFORD,13.955
44-201-0013,EDWARD AT MERCHANT TAYLORS AND WILLIAM AT SEA AND ALL OF THEM MORE BELOVED AND RESPECTED IN THEIR DIFFERENT STATION THAN ANY OTHER THREE BEINGS EVER WERE,13.955
44-201-0014,MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO SIMILAR INFORMATION TO GIVE NO SIMILAR TRIUMPHS TO PRESS ON THE UNWILLING AND UNBELIEVING EAR OF HER FRIEND,9.425
44-201-0015,CONSOLING HERSELF HOWEVER WITH THE DISCOVERY WHICH HER KEEN EYE SOON MADE,8.415
44-201-0016,HERE COME MY DEAR GIRLS CRIED MISSUS THORPE POINTING AT THREE SMART LOOKING FEMALES WHO ARM IN ARM WERE THEN MOVING TOWARDS HER,9.01
44-201-0017,THE TALLEST IS ISABELLA MY ELDEST IS NOT SHE A FINE YOUNG WOMAN THE OTHERS ARE VERY MUCH ADMIRED TOO BUT I BELIEVE ISABELLA IS THE HANDSOMEST,10.605
44-201-0018,THE MISS THORPES WERE INTRODUCED AND MISS MORLAND WHO HAD BEEN FOR A SHORT TIME FORGOTTEN WAS INTRODUCED LIKEWISE THE NAME SEEMED TO STRIKE THEM ALL AND AFTER SPEAKING TO HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY,13.135
44-201-0019,THE ELDEST YOUNG LADY OBSERVED ALOUD TO THE REST HOW EXCESSIVELY LIKE HER BROTHER MISS MORLAND IS,7.2
44-201-0020,WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED BUT MISSUS THORPE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAMES MORLAND,13.785
44-201-0021,BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER ELDEST BROTHER HAD LATELY FORMED AN INTIMACY WITH A YOUNG MAN OF HIS OWN COLLEGE OF THE NAME OF THORPE,8.23
44-201-0022,NEAR LONDON THE WHOLE BEING EXPLAINED MANY OBLIGING THINGS WERE SAID BY THE MISS THORPES OF THEIR WISH OF BEING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER OF BEING CONSIDERED AS ALREADY FRIENDS THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR BROTHERS ET CETERA WHICH CATHERINE HEARD WITH PLEASURE,16.255
44-201-0023,AND ANSWERED WITH ALL THE PRETTY EXPRESSIONS SHE COULD COMMAND AND AS THE FIRST PROOF OF AMITY SHE WAS SOON INVITED TO ACCEPT AN ARM OF THE ELDEST MISS THORPE AND TAKE A TURN WITH HER ABOUT THE ROOM CATHERINE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS EXTENSION OF HER BATH ACQUAINTANCE,16.06
44-201-0024,AND ALMOST FORGOT MISTER TILNEY WHILE SHE TALKED TO MISS THORPE FRIENDSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE FINEST BALM FOR THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THOSE SUBJECTS OF WHICH THE FREE DISCUSSION HAS GENERALLY MUCH TO DO IN PERFECTING A SUDDEN INTIMACY BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES,16.585
44-201-0025,SUCH AS DRESS BALLS FLIRTATIONS AND QUIZZES MISS THORPE HOWEVER BEING FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN MISS MORLAND AND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS BETTER INFORMED,11.58
44-201-0026,SHE COULD COMPARE THE BALLS OF BATH WITH THOSE OF TUNBRIDGE ITS FASHIONS WITH THE FASHIONS OF LONDON COULD RECTIFY THE OPINIONS OF HER NEW FRIEND IN MANY ARTICLES OF TASTEFUL ATTIRE COULD DISCOVER A FLIRTATION BETWEEN ANY GENTLEMAN AND LADY WHO,15.48
44-201-0027,AND POINT OUT A QUIZ THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF A CROWD THESE POWERS RECEIVED DUE ADMIRATION FROM CATHERINE TO WHOM THEY WERE ENTIRELY NEW AND THE RESPECT WHICH THEY NATURALLY INSPIRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT FOR FAMILIARITY,15.005
44-201-0028,HAD NOT THE EASY GAIETY OF MISS THORPE'S MANNERS AND HER FREQUENT EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT ON THIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER SOFTENED DOWN EVERY FEELING OF AWE AND LEFT NOTHING BUT TENDER AFFECTION,13.715
44-201-0029,THEIR INCREASING ATTACHMENT WAS NOT TO BE SATISFIED WITH HALF A DOZEN TURNS IN THE PUMP ROOM BUT REQUIRED WHEN THEY ALL QUITTED IT TOGETHER,7.785
44-201-0030,DOOR OF MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE AND THAT THEY SHOULD THERE PART WITH A MOST AFFECTIONATE AND LENGTHENED SHAKE OF HANDS AFTER LEARNING TO THEIR MUTUAL RELIEF THAT THEY SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER ACROSS THE THEATRE AT NIGHT AND SAY THEIR PRAYERS IN THE SAME CHAPEL,15.545
44-201-0031,THE NEXT MORNING CATHERINE THEN RAN DIRECTLY UPSTAIRS AND WATCHED MISS THORPE'S PROGRESS DOWN THE STREET FROM THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW ADMIRED THE GRACEFUL SPIRIT OF HER WALK THE FASHIONABLE AIR OF HER,14.985
44-201-0032,FIGURE AND DRESS AND FELT GRATEFUL AS WELL SHE MIGHT FOR THE CHANCE WHICH HAD PROCURED HER SUCH A FRIEND MISSUS THORPE WAS A WIDOW AND NOT A VERY RICH ONE SHE WAS A GOOD HUMOURED WELL MEANING WOMAN,15.555
44-201-0033,AND A VERY INDULGENT MOTHER HER ELDEST DAUGHTER HAD GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY AND THE YOUNGER ONES BY PRETENDING TO BE AS HANDSOME AS THEIR SISTER IMITATING HER AIR AND DRESSING IN THE SAME STYLE DID VERY WELL,15.395
44-201-0034,THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY IS INTENDED TO SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY OF A LONG AND MINUTE DETAIL FROM MISSUS THORPE HERSELF OF HER PAST ADVENTURES AND SUFFERINGS,10.3099375
44-201-0035,IN WHICH THE WORTHLESSNESS OF LORDS AND ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE SET FORTH,5.455
44-207-0000,NOW MISTER MORLAND FOR HE WAS CLOSE TO HER ON THE OTHER SIDE I SHALL NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO YOU ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING SO I CHARGE YOU NOT TO EXPECT IT MY SWEETEST CATHERINE HOW HAVE YOU BEEN THIS LONG AGE,15.26
44-207-0001,BUT I NEED NOT ASK YOU FOR YOU LOOK DELIGHTFULLY YOU REALLY HAVE DONE YOUR HAIR IN A MORE HEAVENLY STYLE THAN EVER,6.97
44-207-0002,I ASSURE YOU MY BROTHER IS QUITE IN LOVE WITH YOU ALREADY AND AS FOR MISTER TILNEY BUT THAT IS A SETTLED THING EVEN YOUR MODESTY CANNOT DOUBT HIS ATTACHMENT NOW HIS COMING BACK TO BATH MAKES IT TOO PLAIN OH,15.195
44-207-0003,WHAT WOULD NOT I GIVE TO SEE HIM I REALLY AM QUITE WILD WITH IMPATIENCE MY MOTHER SAYS HE IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD SHE SAW HIM THIS MORNING YOU KNOW YOU MUST INTRODUCE HIM TO ME,13.71
44-207-0004,IS HE IN THE HOUSE NOW LOOK ABOUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I ASSURE YOU I CAN HARDLY EXIST TILL I SEE HIM NO SAID CATHERINE HE IS NOT HERE I CANNOT SEE HIM ANYWHERE OH HORRID,15.21
44-207-0005,AM I NEVER TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM HOW DO YOU LIKE MY GOWN I THINK IT DOES NOT LOOK AMISS THE SLEEVES WERE ENTIRELY MY OWN THOUGHT DO YOU KNOW I GET SO IMMODERATELY SICK OF BATH,12.115
44-207-0006,YOUR BROTHER AND I WERE AGREEING THIS MORNING THAT THOUGH IT IS VASTLY WELL TO BE HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS WE WOULD NOT LIVE HERE FOR MILLIONS WE SOON FOUND OUT THAT OUR TASTES WERE EXACTLY ALIKE IN PREFERRING THE COUNTRY TO EVERY OTHER PLACE,13.805
44-207-0007,REALLY OUR OPINIONS WERE SO EXACTLY THE SAME IT WAS QUITE RIDICULOUS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE POINT IN WHICH WE DIFFERED I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD YOU ARE SUCH A SLY THING I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE SOME DROLL REMARK OR OTHER ABOUT IT,16.025
44-207-0008,NO INDEED I SHOULD NOT OH YES YOU WOULD INDEED I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF,6.51
44-207-0009,OR SOME NONSENSE OF THAT KIND WHICH WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED ME BEYOND CONCEPTION,4.35
44-207-0010,I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD INDEED YOU DO ME INJUSTICE I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SO IMPROPER A REMARK UPON ANY ACCOUNT AND BESIDES I AM SURE IT WOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED MY HEAD,13.815
44-207-0011,ISABELLA SMILED INCREDULOUSLY AND TALKED THE REST OF THE EVENING TO JAMES CATHERINE'S RESOLUTION OF ENDEAVOURING TO MEET MISS TILNEY AGAIN CONTINUED IN FULL FORCE THE NEXT MORNING,12.025
44-207-0012,AND TILL THE USUAL MOMENT OF GOING TO THE PUMP ROOM SHE FELT SOME ALARM FROM THE DREAD OF A SECOND PREVENTION BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND OCCURRED NO VISITORS APPEARED TO DELAY THEM AND THEY ALL THREE SET OFF IN GOOD TIME FOR THE PUMP ROOM,13.505
44-207-0013,WHERE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS AND CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE MISTER ALLEN AFTER DRINKING HIS GLASS OF WATER JOINED SOME GENTLEMEN TO TALK OVER THE POLITICS OF THE DAY AND COMPARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR NEWSPAPERS,12.765
44-207-0014,AND THE LADIES WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER NOTICING EVERY NEW FACE AND ALMOST EVERY NEW BONNET IN THE ROOM THE FEMALE PART OF THE THORPE FAMILY ATTENDED BY JAMES MORLAND APPEARED AMONG THE CROWD IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR,13.885
44-207-0015,AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY TOOK HER USUAL PLACE BY THE SIDE OF HER FRIEND JAMES WHO WAS NOW IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE MAINTAINED A SIMILAR POSITION AND SEPARATING THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THEIR PARTY THEY WALKED IN THAT MANNER FOR SOME TIME,15.115
44-207-0016,TILL CATHERINE BEGAN TO DOUBT THE HAPPINESS OF A SITUATION WHICH CONFINING HER ENTIRELY TO HER FRIEND AND BROTHER GAVE HER VERY LITTLE SHARE IN THE NOTICE OF EITHER THEY WERE ALWAYS ENGAGED IN SOME SENTIMENTAL DISCUSSION OR LIVELY DISPUTE,16.81
44-207-0017,THAT THOUGH CATHERINE'S SUPPORTING OPINION WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY CALLED FOR BY ONE OR THE OTHER SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GIVE ANY,7.46
44-207-0018,AT LENGTH HOWEVER SHE WAS EMPOWERED TO DISENGAGE HERSELF FROM HER FRIEND BY THE AVOWED NECESSITY OF SPEAKING TO MISS TILNEY WHOM SHE MOST JOYFULLY SAW JUST ENTERING THE ROOM WITH MISSUS HUGHES,12.635
44-207-0019,AND WHOM SHE INSTANTLY JOINED WITH A FIRMER DETERMINATION TO BE ACQUAINTED THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD COURAGE TO COMMAND HAD SHE NOT BEEN URGED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE DAY BEFORE MISS TILNEY MET HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY,14.53
44-207-0020,RETURNED HER ADVANCES WITH EQUAL GOODWILL AND THEY CONTINUED TALKING TOGETHER AS LONG AS BOTH PARTIES REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND THOUGH IN ALL PROBABILITY NOT AN OBSERVATION WAS MADE,11.95
44-207-0021,NOR AN EXPRESSION USED BY EITHER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND USED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE UNDER THAT ROOF IN EVERY BATH SEASON,8.64
44-207-0022,HOW WELL YOUR BROTHER DANCES WAS AN ARTLESS EXCLAMATION OF CATHERINE'S TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH AT ONCE SURPRISED AND AMUSED HER COMPANION HENRY SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE YES HE DOES DANCE VERY WELL,15.32
44-207-0023,HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT VERY ODD TO HEAR ME SAY I WAS ENGAGED THE OTHER EVENING WHEN HE SAW ME SITTING DOWN BUT I REALLY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHOLE DAY TO MISTER THORPE MISS TILNEY COULD ONLY BOW,11.515
44-207-0024,HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO SEE HIM AGAIN I FELT SO SURE OF HIS BEING QUITE GONE AWAY,6.365
44-207-0025,HE CAME ONLY TO ENGAGE LODGINGS FOR US,3.13
44-207-0026,WAS NOT THE YOUNG LADY HE DANCED WITH ON MONDAY A MISS SMITH YES AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS HUGHES I DARE SAY SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO DANCE DO YOU THINK HER PRETTY NOT VERY,14.46
44-207-0027,HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP ROOM I SUPPOSE YES SOMETIMES BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER MISSUS HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO GO,11.75
44-207-0028,I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AGAIN SOON SAID CATHERINE SHALL YOU BE AT THE COTILLION BALL TOMORROW PERHAPS WE YES I THINK WE CERTAINLY SHALL I AM GLAD OF IT FOR WE SHALL ALL BE THERE,15.23
44-207-0029,THIS CIVILITY WAS DULY RETURNED AND THEY PARTED ON MISS TILNEY'S SIDE WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE'S FEELINGS AND ON CATHERINE'S WITHOUT THE SMALLEST CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING EXPLAINED THEM SHE WENT HOME VERY HAPPY,15.16
44-207-0030,THE MORNING HAD ANSWERED ALL HER HOPES AND THE EVENING OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS NOW THE OBJECT OF EXPECTATION THE FUTURE GOOD WHAT GOWN AND WHAT HEAD DRESS SHE SHOULD WEAR ON THE OCCASION BECAME HER CHIEF CONCERN,11.5
44-207-0031,SHE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IT DRESS IS AT ALL TIMES A FRIVOLOUS DISTINCTION AND EXCESSIVE SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT OFTEN DESTROYS ITS OWN AIM CATHERINE KNEW ALL THIS VERY WELL HER GREAT AUNT HAD READ HER A LECTURE ON THE SUBJECT ONLY THE CHRISTMAS BEFORE,16.37
44-207-0032,AND YET SHE LAY AWAKE TEN MINUTES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT DEBATING BETWEEN HER SPOTTED AND HER TAMBOURED MUSLIN AND NOTHING BUT THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME PREVENTED HER BUYING A NEW ONE FOR THE EVENING THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT,15.275
44-207-0033,GREAT THOUGH NOT UNCOMMON FROM WHICH ONE OF THE OTHER SEX RATHER THAN HER OWN A BROTHER RATHER THAN A GREAT AUNT MIGHT HAVE WARNED HER,8.66
44-207-0034,WHAT IS COSTLY OR NEW IN THEIR ATTIRE HOW LITTLE IT IS BIASED BY THE TEXTURE OF THEIR MUSLIN AND HOW UNSUSCEPTIBLE OF PECULIAR TENDERNESS TOWARDS THE SPOTTED,13.3
44-207-0035,WOMAN IS FINE FOR HER OWN SATISFACTION ALONE NO MAN WILL ADMIRE HER THE MORE NO WOMAN WILL LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR IT,9.16
44-207-0036,NEATNESS AND FASHION ARE ENOUGH FOR THE FORMER AND A SOMETHING OF SHABBINESS OR IMPROPRIETY WILL BE MOST ENDEARING TO THE LATTER BUT NOT ONE OF THESE GRAVE REFLECTIONS TROUBLED THE TRANQUILLITY OF CATHERINE,13.855
44-207-0037,SHE ENTERED THE ROOMS ON THURSDAY EVENING WITH FEELINGS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAD ATTENDED HER THITHER THE MONDAY BEFORE,6.84
44-207-0038,AND WAS NOW CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID HIS SIGHT LEST HE SHOULD ENGAGE HER AGAIN FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT DARED NOT EXPECT THAT MISTER TILNEY SHOULD ASK HER A THIRD TIME TO DANCE,11.82
44-207-0039,HER WISHES HOPES AND PLANS ALL CENTRED IN NOTHING LESS EVERY YOUNG LADY MAY FEEL FOR MY HEROINE IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT FOR EVERY YOUNG LADY HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THE SAME AGITATION,15.525
44-207-0040,ALL HAVE BEEN OR AT LEAST ALL HAVE BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE IN DANGER FROM THE PURSUIT OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY WISHED TO AVOID AND ALL HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY,15.27
44-207-0041,WISHED TO PLEASE AS SOON AS THEY WERE JOINED BY THE THORPES CATHERINE'S AGONY BEGAN SHE FIDGETED ABOUT IF JOHN THORPE CAME TOWARDS HER HID HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM HIS VIEW AND WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM,15.7
44-207-0042,THE COTILLIONS WERE OVER THE COUNTRY DANCING BEGINNING AND SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE TILNEYS DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED MY DEAR CATHERINE WHISPERED ISABELLA BUT I AM REALLY GOING TO DANCE WITH YOUR BROTHER AGAIN,13.475
44-207-0043,I DECLARE POSITIVELY IT IS QUITE SHOCKING I TELL HIM HE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF BUT YOU AND JOHN MUST KEEP US IN COUNTENANCE MAKE HASTE MY DEAR CREATURE AND COME TO US JOHN IS JUST WALKED OFF BUT HE WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT,16.325
44-207-0044,CATHERINE HAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO ANSWER THE OTHERS WALKED AWAY JOHN THORPE WAS STILL IN VIEW AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP FOR LOST THAT SHE MIGHT NOT APPEAR HOWEVER TO OBSERVE OR EXPECT HIM,12.905
44-207-0045,SHE KEPT HER EYES INTENTLY FIXED ON HER FAN AND A SELF CONDEMNATION FOR HER FOLLY IN SUPPOSING THAT AMONG SUCH A CROWD THEY SHOULD EVEN MEET WITH THE TILNEYS IN ANY REASONABLE TIME HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH HER MIND WHEN SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HERSELF ADDRESSED,14.26
44-207-0046,AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE BY MISTER TILNEY HIMSELF WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT WITH HIM TO THE SET MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED,14.335
44-207-0047,TO ESCAPE AND AS SHE BELIEVED SO NARROWLY ESCAPE JOHN THORPE AND TO BE ASKED SO IMMEDIATELY ON HIS JOINING HER ASKED BY MISTER TILNEY AS IF HE HAD SOUGHT HER ON PURPOSE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT LIFE COULD SUPPLY ANY GREATER FELICITY,15.285
44-207-0048,TILNEY HE REPEATED HUM I DO NOT KNOW HIM A GOOD FIGURE OF A MAN WELL PUT TOGETHER,6.65
44-207-0049,A FAMOUS CLEVER ANIMAL FOR THE ROAD ONLY FORTY GUINEAS I HAD FIFTY MINDS TO BUY IT MYSELF,6.25
44-207-0050,BUT IT WOULD NOT ANSWER MY PURPOSE IT WOULD NOT DO FOR THE FIELD I WOULD GIVE ANY MONEY FOR A REAL GOOD HUNTER I HAVE THREE NOW THE BEST THAT EVER WERE BACKED I WOULD NOT TAKE EIGHT HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR THEM,12.305
44-207-0051,THIS WAS THE LAST SENTENCE BY WHICH HE COULD WEARY CATHERINE'S ATTENTION FOR HE WAS JUST THEN BORNE OFF BY THE RESISTLESS PRESSURE OF A LONG STRING OF PASSING LADIES HER PARTNER NOW DREW NEAR AND SAID,13.51
44-207-0052,THAT GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE PUT ME OUT OF PATIENCE HAD HE STAYED WITH YOU HALF A MINUTE LONGER HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO WITHDRAW THE ATTENTION OF MY PARTNER FROM ME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT OF MUTUAL AGREEABLENESS FOR THE SPACE OF AN EVENING,13.935
44-207-0053,AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE,12.515
44-207-0054,FIDELITY AND COMPLAISANCE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF BOTH AND THOSE MEN WHO DO NOT CHOOSE TO DANCE OR MARRY THEMSELVES HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THE PARTNERS OR WIVES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY ARE SUCH VERY DIFFERENT THINGS,13.705
44-207-0055,THAT YOU THINK THEY CANNOT BE COMPARED TOGETHER TO BE SURE NOT PEOPLE THAT MARRY CAN NEVER PART BUT MUST GO AND KEEP HOUSE TOGETHER PEOPLE THAT DANCE ONLY STAND OPPOSITE EACH OTHER IN A LONG ROOM FOR HALF AN HOUR,13.755
44-207-0056,AND SUCH IS YOUR DEFINITION OF MATRIMONY AND DANCING TAKEN IN THAT LIGHT CERTAINLY THEIR RESEMBLANCE IS NOT STRIKING BUT I THINK I COULD PLACE THEM IN SUCH A VIEW YOU WILL ALLOW THAT IN BOTH MAN HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF CHOICE WOMAN ONLY THE POWER OF REFUSAL,16.57
44-207-0057,THAT IN BOTH IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN FORMED FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF EACH AND THAT WHEN ONCE ENTERED INTO THEY BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO EACH OTHER TILL THE MOMENT OF ITS DISSOLUTION THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY,13.775
44-207-0058,EACH TO ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE THE OTHER NO CAUSE FOR WISHING THAT HE OR SHE HAD BESTOWED THEMSELVES ELSEWHERE AND THEIR BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS FROM WANDERING TOWARDS THE PERFECTIONS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS,12.265
44-207-0059,YOU WILL ALLOW ALL THIS YES TO BE SURE AS YOU STATE IT ALL THIS SOUNDS VERY WELL BUT STILL THEY ARE SO VERY DIFFERENT I CANNOT LOOK UPON THEM AT ALL IN THE SAME LIGHT NOR THINK THE SAME DUTIES BELONG TO THEM IN ONE RESPECT THERE CERTAINLY IS A DIFFERENCE,16.585
44-207-0060,IN MARRIAGE THE MAN IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN TO MAKE THE HOME AGREEABLE TO THE MAN HE IS TO PURVEY AND SHE IS TO SMILE BUT IN DANCING THEIR DUTIES ARE EXACTLY CHANGED,14.365
44-207-0061,THE AGREEABLENESS THE COMPLIANCE ARE EXPECTED FROM HIM WHILE SHE FURNISHES THE FAN AND THE LAVENDER WATER THAT I SUPPOSE WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF DUTIES WHICH STRUCK YOU AS RENDERING THE CONDITIONS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON,14.18
44-207-0062,NO INDEED I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEN I AM QUITE AT A LOSS ONE THING HOWEVER I MUST OBSERVE THIS DISPOSITION ON YOUR SIDE IS RATHER ALARMING,10.695
44-207-0063,YOU TOTALLY DISALLOW ANY SIMILARITY IN THE OBLIGATIONS AND MAY I NOT THENCE INFER THAT YOUR NOTIONS OF THE DUTIES OF THE DANCING STATE ARE NOT SO STRICT AS YOUR PARTNER MIGHT WISH HAVE I NOT REASON TO FEAR THAT IF THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE TO YOU JUST NOW WERE TO RETURN,15.71
44-207-0064,MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS,14.455
44-207-0065,FOR IF I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TALK TO THEM AND BESIDES I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A SECURITY WORTH HAVING AND I SHALL PROCEED WITH COURAGE,13.125
44-207-0066,DO YOU FIND BATH AS AGREEABLE AS WHEN I HAD THE HONOUR OF MAKING THE INQUIRY BEFORE YES QUITE MORE SO INDEED MORE SO TAKE CARE OR YOU WILL FORGET TO BE TIRED OF IT AT THE PROPER TIME YOU OUGHT TO BE TIRED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS,15.985
44-207-0067,I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE TIRED IF I WERE TO STAY HERE SIX MONTHS BATH COMPARED WITH LONDON HAS LITTLE VARIETY AND SO EVERYBODY FINDS OUT EVERY YEAR FOR SIX WEEKS I ALLOW BATH IS PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT BEYOND THAT IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME PLACE IN THE WORLD,15.445
44-207-0068,WELL OTHER PEOPLE MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE WHO GO TO LONDON MAY THINK NOTHING OF BATH BUT I WHO LIVE IN A SMALL RETIRED VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY CAN NEVER FIND GREATER SAMENESS IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAN IN MY OWN HOME,12.99
44-207-0069,WHICH I CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THERE YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY YES I AM I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY,8.87
44-207-0070,ONE DAY IN THE COUNTRY IS EXACTLY LIKE ANOTHER BUT THEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO MUCH MORE RATIONALLY IN THE COUNTRY DO I DO YOU NOT I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH DIFFERENCE HERE YOU ARE IN PURSUIT ONLY OF AMUSEMENT ALL DAY LONG,16.245
44-207-0071,AND SO I AM AT HOME ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT I WALK ABOUT HERE AND SO I DO THERE BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY STREET AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN,13.09
44-207-0072,MISTER TILNEY WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN HE REPEATED WHAT A PICTURE OF INTELLECTUAL POVERTY HOWEVER WHEN YOU SINK INTO THIS ABYSS AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY,13.17

44-207-0078,OF A COMMANDING ASPECT PAST THE BLOOM BUT NOT PAST THE VIGOUR OF LIFE AND WITH HIS EYE STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS HER SHE SAW HIM PRESENTLY ADDRESS MISTER TILNEY IN A FAMILIAR WHISPER,12.005
44-207-0079,CONFUSED BY HIS NOTICE AND BLUSHING FROM THE FEAR OF ITS BEING EXCITED BY SOMETHING WRONG IN HER APPEARANCE SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD,8.03

44-207-0084,AND DO NOT LET US PUT IT OFF LET US GO TOMORROW THIS WAS READILY AGREED TO WITH ONLY A PROVISO OF MISS TILNEY'S THAT IT DID NOT RAIN WHICH CATHERINE WAS SURE IT WOULD NOT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THEY WERE TO CALL FOR HER IN PULTENEY STREET AND REMEMBER,14.765

45-121050-0004,HE HAD COME TO NO DETERMINATION AND AS NOTHING IN THE COUNT'S MANNER MANIFESTED THE WISH THAT HE SHOULD RECOGNIZE HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO MAKE ANY ALLUSION TO THE PAST OR WAIT UNTIL HE HAD MORE PROOF,11.345
45-121050-0005,BESIDES ALTHOUGH SURE IT WAS HE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE BOX THE PREVIOUS EVENING HE COULD NOT BE EQUALLY POSITIVE,5.92
45-121050-0006,MOREOVER HE HAD THIS ADVANTAGE HE WAS MASTER OF THE COUNT'S SECRET WHILE THE COUNT HAD NO HOLD ON FRANZ WHO HAD NOTHING TO CONCEAL HOWEVER HE RESOLVED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY CLEAR UP HIS DOUBTS,13.705
45-121050-0007,COUNT SAID HE YOU HAVE OFFERED US PLACES IN YOUR CARRIAGE AND AT YOUR WINDOWS IN THE ROSPOLI PALACE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE WE CAN OBTAIN A SIGHT OF THE PIAZZA DEL POPOLO AH SAID THE COUNT NEGLIGENTLY LOOKING ATTENTIVELY AT MORCERF,14.3

45-121050-0020,BUT I THINK SINCE YESTERDAY SOME CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE ORDER OF THE CEREMONY REALLY SAID FRANZ,6.73
45-121050-0021,AND THERE MENTION WAS MADE OF SOMETHING LIKE A PARDON FOR ONE OF THE TWO MEN FOR ANDREA RONDOLO ASKED FRANZ NO REPLIED THE COUNT CARELESSLY FOR THE OTHER HE GLANCED AT THE TABLETS AS IF TO RECALL THE NAME FOR PEPPINO CALLED ROCCA PRIORI,14.795
45-121050-0022,AND EVEN THE SECOND WHILE THE OTHER AS YOU MUST KNOW IS VERY SIMPLE THE MANDAIA NEVER FAILS NEVER TREMBLES NEVER STRIKES THIRTY TIMES INEFFECTUALLY,9.28
45-121050-0023,AND TO WHOSE TENDER MERCY RICHELIEU HAD DOUBTLESS RECOMMENDED THE SUFFERER AH ADDED THE COUNT IN A CONTEMPTUOUS TONE,6.795
45-121050-0024,THERE ARE AT LEAST FEW THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN SAID THE COUNT COLDLY AND YOU TOOK PLEASURE IN BEHOLDING THESE DREADFUL SPECTACLES MY FIRST SENTIMENT WAS HORROR THE SECOND INDIFFERENCE THE THIRD CURIOSITY,14.38
45-121050-0025,CURIOSITY THAT IS A TERRIBLE WORD WHY SO IN LIFE OUR GREATEST PREOCCUPATION IS DEATH IS IT NOT THEN CURIOUS TO STUDY THE DIFFERENT WAYS BY WHICH THE SOUL AND BODY CAN PART,14.07
45-121050-0026,AND HOW ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TEMPERAMENTS AND EVEN THE DIFFERENT CUSTOMS OF THEIR COUNTRIES DIFFERENT PERSONS BEAR THE TRANSITION FROM LIFE TO DEATH FROM EXISTENCE TO ANNIHILATION AS FOR MYSELF I CAN ASSURE YOU OF ONE THING,13.81
45-121050-0027,THE MORE MEN YOU SEE DIE THE EASIER IT BECOMES TO DIE YOURSELF,3.83
45-121050-0028,BUT IT IS NOT AN EXPIATION I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU REPLIED FRANZ PRAY EXPLAIN YOUR MEANING FOR YOU EXCITE MY CURIOSITY TO THE HIGHEST PITCH,10.99
45-121050-0029,LISTEN SAID THE COUNT AND DEEP HATRED MOUNTED TO HIS FACE AS THE BLOOD WOULD TO THE FACE OF ANY OTHER IF A MAN HAD BY UNHEARD OF AND EXCRUCIATING TORTURES DESTROYED YOUR FATHER YOUR MOTHER YOUR BETROTHED A,13.52
45-121050-0030,A WOUND THAT NEVER CLOSES IN YOUR BREAST DO YOU THINK THE REPARATION THAT SOCIETY GIVES YOU IS SUFFICIENT,6.915
45-121050-0031,TO ESCAPE WITH A FEW MOMENTS OF PHYSICAL PAIN YES I KNOW SAID FRANZ THAT HUMAN JUSTICE IS INSUFFICIENT TO CONSOLE US SHE CAN GIVE BLOOD IN RETURN FOR BLOOD THAT IS ALL BUT YOU MUST DEMAND FROM HER ONLY WHAT IT IS IN HER POWER TO GRANT,16.04
45-121050-0032,I WILL PUT ANOTHER CASE TO YOU CONTINUED THE COUNT THAT WHERE SOCIETY ATTACKED BY THE DEATH OF A PERSON AVENGES DEATH BY DEATH BUT ARE THERE NOT A THOUSAND TORTURES BY WHICH A MAN MAY BE MADE TO SUFFER WITHOUT SOCIETY TAKING THE LEAST COGNIZANCE OF THEM,15.39
45-121050-0033,OR OFFERING HIM EVEN THE INSUFFICIENT MEANS OF VENGEANCE OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST SPOKEN ARE THERE NOT CRIMES FOR WHICH THE IMPALEMENT OF THE TURKS THE AUGERS OF THE PERSIANS THE STAKE AND THE BRAND OF THE IROQUOIS INDIANS ARE INADEQUATE TORTURES,15.31
45-121050-0034,AND WHICH ARE UNPUNISHED BY SOCIETY ANSWER ME DO NOT THESE CRIMES EXIST YES ANSWERED FRANZ AND IT IS TO PUNISH THEM THAT DUELLING IS TOLERATED AH DUELLING CRIED THE COUNT A,15.21
45-121050-0035,PLEASANT MANNER UPON MY SOUL OF ARRIVING AT YOUR END WHEN THAT END IS VENGEANCE A MAN HAS CARRIED OFF YOUR MISTRESS A MAN HAS SEDUCED YOUR WIFE A MAN HAS DISHONORED YOUR DAUGHTER,12.07
45-121050-0036,HE HAS RENDERED THE WHOLE LIFE OF ONE WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO EXPECT FROM HEAVEN THAT PORTION OF HAPPINESS GOD HAS PROMISED TO EVERY ONE OF HIS CREATURES AN EXISTENCE OF MISERY AND INFAMY AND YOU THINK YOU ARE AVENGED BECAUSE YOU SEND A BALL THROUGH THE HEAD,14.595
45-121050-0037,OR PASS A SWORD THROUGH THE BREAST OF THAT MAN WHO HAS PLANTED MADNESS IN YOUR BRAIN AND DESPAIR IN YOUR HEART AND REMEMBER MOREOVER THAT IT IS OFTEN HE,9.425
45-121050-0038,NO NO CONTINUED THE COUNT HAD I TO AVENGE MYSELF IT IS NOT THUS I WOULD TAKE REVENGE THEN YOU DISAPPROVE OF DUELLING YOU WOULD NOT FIGHT A DUEL ASKED ALBERT IN HIS TURN ASTONISHED AT THIS STRANGE THEORY,14.12
45-121050-0039,OH YES REPLIED THE COUNT UNDERSTAND ME I WOULD FIGHT A DUEL FOR A TRIFLE FOR AN INSULT FOR A BLOW AND THE MORE SO THAT THANKS TO MY SKILL IN ALL BODILY EXERCISES AND THE INDIFFERENCE TO DANGER I HAVE GRADUALLY ACQUIRED,13.575
45-121050-0040,I SHOULD BE ALMOST CERTAIN TO KILL MY MAN OH I WOULD FIGHT FOR SUCH A CAUSE BUT IN RETURN FOR A SLOW PROFOUND ETERNAL TORTURE I WOULD GIVE BACK THE SAME WERE IT POSSIBLE AN EYE FOR AN EYE A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH AS THE ORIENTALISTS SAY,16.125
45-121050-0041,BUT SAID FRANZ TO THE COUNT WITH THIS THEORY WHICH RENDERS YOU AT ONCE JUDGE AND EXECUTIONER OF YOUR OWN CAUSE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ADOPT A COURSE THAT WOULD FOREVER PREVENT YOUR FALLING UNDER THE POWER OF THE LAW HATRED IS BLIND RAGE CARRIES YOU AWAY,15.455
45-121050-0042,AND HE WHO POURS OUT VENGEANCE RUNS THE RISK OF TASTING A BITTER DRAUGHT YES IF HE BE POOR AND INEXPERIENCED NOT IF HE BE RICH AND SKILFUL BESIDES THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN TO HIM WOULD BE THE PUNISHMENT OF WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN,14.85
45-121050-0043,AND WHICH THE PHILANTHROPIC FRENCH REVOLUTION HAS SUBSTITUTED FOR BEING TORN TO PIECES BY HORSES OR BROKEN ON THE WHEEL WHAT MATTERS THIS PUNISHMENT AS LONG AS HE IS AVENGED ON MY WORD I ALMOST REGRET THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY,14.415
45-121050-0044,THIS MISERABLE PEPPINO WILL NOT BE BEHEADED AS YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THEN OF SEEING HOW SHORT A TIME THE PUNISHMENT LASTS AND WHETHER IT IS WORTH EVEN MENTIONING,9.415
46-127996-0000,CROMWELL HAD TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE WOULD PUT TO HAZARD THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS PARTY THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS ARMY HIS OWN GREATNESS NAY HIS OWN LIFE IN AN ATTEMPT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN VAIN TO SAVE A PRINCE WHOM NO ENGAGEMENT COULD BIND,16.325
46-127996-0001,WITH MANY STRUGGLES AND MISGIVINGS AND PROBABLY NOT WITHOUT MANY PRAYERS THE DECISION WAS MADE CHARLES WAS LEFT TO HIS FATE THE MILITARY SAINTS RESOLVED THAT IN DEFIANCE OF THE OLD LAWS OF THE REALM,14.235
46-127996-0002,AND OF THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL SENTIMENT OF THE NATION THE KING SHOULD EXPIATE HIS CRIMES WITH HIS BLOOD HE FOR A TIME EXPECTED A DEATH LIKE THAT OF HIS UNHAPPY PREDECESSORS EDWARD THE SECOND AND RICHARD THE SECOND,15.18
46-127996-0003,BUT HE WAS IN NO DANGER OF SUCH TREASON THOSE WHO HAD HIM IN THEIR GRIPE WERE NOT MIDNIGHT STABBERS WHAT THEY DID THEY DID IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT BE A SPECTACLE TO HEAVEN AND EARTH AND THAT IT MIGHT BE HELD IN EVERLASTING REMEMBRANCE,15.66
46-127996-0004,TO A PARTY BENT ON EFFECTING A COMPLETE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL REVOLUTION IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST BREAK IN PIECES EVERY PART OF THE MACHINERY OF THE GOVERNMENT,14.675
46-127996-0005,THE LORDS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED THE PROPOSITION THAT THE KING SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THEIR HOUSE WAS INSTANTLY CLOSED NO COURT KNOWN TO THE LAW WOULD TAKE ON ITSELF THE OFFICE OF JUDGING THE FOUNTAIN OF JUSTICE,14.265
46-127996-0006,A REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL WAS CREATED THAT TRIBUNAL PRONOUNCED CHARLES A TYRANT A TRAITOR A MURDERER AND A PUBLIC ENEMY AND HIS HEAD WAS SEVERED FROM HIS SHOULDERS BEFORE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS IN FRONT OF THE BANQUETING HALL,15.18
46-127996-0007,OF HIS OWN PALACE IN NO LONG TIME IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT THOSE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS TO WHOM THIS DEED IS TO BE ASCRIBED HAD COMMITTED NOT ONLY A CRIME BUT AN ERROR,14.57
46-127996-0008,ALL HIS REGAL DIGNITY AND CONFRONTING DEATH WITH DAUNTLESS COURAGE GAVE UTTERANCE TO THE FEELINGS OF HIS OPPRESSED PEOPLE MANFULLY REFUSED TO PLEAD BEFORE A COURT UNKNOWN TO THE LAW APPEALED FROM MILITARY VIOLENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION,16.105
46-127996-0009,ASKED BY WHAT RIGHT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN PURGED OF ITS MOST RESPECTABLE MEMBERS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS DEPRIVED OF ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS AND TOLD HIS WEEPING HEARERS THAT HE WAS DEFENDING NOT ONLY HIS OWN CAUSE BUT THEIRS,15.225
46-127996-0010,REACTION WHICH NEVER CEASED TILL THE THRONE HAD AGAIN BEEN SET UP IN ALL ITS OLD DIGNITY AT FIRST HOWEVER THE SLAYERS OF THE KING SEEMED TO HAVE DERIVED NEW ENERGY FROM THAT SACRAMENT OF BLOOD BY WHICH THEY HAD BOUND THEMSELVES CLOSELY TOGETHER,16.085
46-127996-0011,AND SEPARATED THEMSELVES FOR EVER FROM THE GREAT BODY OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN ENGLAND WAS DECLARED A COMMONWEALTH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS REDUCED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF MEMBERS WAS NOMINALLY THE SUPREME POWER IN THE STATE IN FACT,15.39
46-127996-0012,THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE ROUNDHEADS THE ANGLICAN CHURCH THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ENGLAND SCOTLAND IRELAND YET SUCH WAS HIS GENIUS AND RESOLUTION,12.5
46-127996-0013,THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OVERPOWER AND CRUSH EVERYTHING THAT CROSSED HIS PATH TO MAKE HIMSELF MORE ABSOLUTE MASTER OF HIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS HAD BEEN AND TO MAKE HIS COUNTRY MORE DREADED AND RESPECTED THAN SHE HAD BEEN DURING MANY GENERATIONS,15.64
46-127996-0014,UNDER THE RULE OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS ENGLAND HAD ALREADY CEASED TO STRUGGLE BUT THE TWO OTHER KINGDOMS WHICH HAD BEEN GOVERNED BY THE STUARTS WERE HOSTILE TO THE NEW REPUBLIC THE INDEPENDENT PARTY WAS EQUALLY ODIOUS TO THE ROMAN CATHOLICS OF IRELAND,15.21
46-127996-0015,AND TO THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND BOTH THOSE COUNTRIES LATELY IN REBELLION AGAINST CHARLES THE FIRST NOW ACKNOWLEDGED THE AUTHORITY OF CHARLES THE SECOND BUT EVERYTHING YIELDED TO THE VIGOUR AND ABILITY OF CROMWELL,13.96
46-127996-0016,IN A FEW MONTHS HE SUBJUGATED IRELAND AS IRELAND HAD NEVER BEEN SUBJUGATED DURING THE FIVE CENTURIES OF SLAUGHTER WHICH HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE LANDING OF THE FIRST NORMAN SETTLERS,11.065
46-127996-0017,BY MAKING THE ENGLISH AND PROTESTANT POPULATION DECIDEDLY PREDOMINANT FOR THIS END HE GAVE THE REIN TO THE FIERCE ENTHUSIASM OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAGED WAR RESEMBLING THAT WHICH ISRAEL WAGED ON THE CANAANITES SMOTE THE IDOLATERS WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD,15.885
46-127996-0018,DROVE MANY THOUSANDS TO THE CONTINENT SHIPPED OFF MANY THOUSANDS TO THE WEST INDIES AND SUPPLIED THE VOID THUS MADE BY POURING IN NUMEROUS COLONISTS OF SAXON BLOOD AND OF CALVINISTIC FAITH STRANGE TO SAY UNDER THAT IRON RULE,14.86
46-127996-0019,AND TO CLAMOUR FOR PROTECTING LAWS FROM IRELAND THE VICTORIOUS CHIEF,5.25
46-127996-0020,HE HAD CONSENTED TO PROFESS HIMSELF A PRESBYTERIAN,2.985
46-127996-0021,THE AUSTERE PURITANS,1.885
46-127996-0022,UNDER THEIR INSPECTION AND CONTROL A SOLEMN AND MELANCHOLY COURT THIS MOCK ROYALTY WAS OF SHORT DURATION IN TWO GREAT BATTLES CROMWELL ANNIHILATED THE MILITARY FORCE OF SCOTLAND CHARLES FLED FOR HIS LIFE AND,13.8349375
46-127996-0023,WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY ESCAPED THE FATE OF HIS FATHER THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE STUARTS WAS REDUCED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO PROFOUND SUBMISSION OF THAT INDEPENDENCE SO MANFULLY DEFENDED AGAINST THE MIGHTIEST AND ABLEST OF THE PLANTAGENETS,15.0050625
46-127996-0024,NO VESTIGE WAS LEFT THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT MADE LAWS FOR SCOTLAND ENGLISH JUDGES HELD ASSIZES IN SCOTLAND EVEN THAT STUBBORN CHURCH WHICH HAS HELD ITS OWN AGAINST SO MANY GOVERNMENTS SCARCE DARED TO UTTER AN AUDIBLE MURMUR,16.13
46-127996-0025,THE PARLIAMENT FORGOT THAT IT WAS BUT THE CREATURE OF THE ARMY THE ARMY WAS LESS DISPOSED THAN EVER TO SUBMIT TO THE DICTATION OF THE PARLIAMENT INDEED,9.465
46-127996-0026,THE FEW MEMBERS WHO MADE UP WHAT WAS CONTEMPTUOUSLY CALLED THE RUMP OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD NO MORE CLAIM THAN THE MILITARY CHIEFS TO BE ESTEEMED THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION THE DISPUTE WAS SOON BROUGHT TO A DECISIVE ISSUE CROMWELL FILLED THE HOUSE WITH ARMED MEN,15.47
46-127996-0027,THE SPEAKER WAS PULLED OUT OF HIS CHAIR THE MACE TAKEN FROM THE TABLE THE ROOM CLEARED AND THE DOOR LOCKED THE NATION WHICH LOVED NEITHER OF THE CONTENDING PARTIES BUT WHICH WAS FORCED IN ITS OWN DESPITE,12.685
46-127996-0028,YET WERE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS STILL IMPOSED ON HIM BY THE VERY ARMY TO WHICH HE OWED HIS IMMENSE AUTHORITY THAT SINGULAR BODY OF MEN WAS FOR THE MOST PART COMPOSED OF ZEALOUS REPUBLICANS,12.135
46-127996-0029,AND PINED FOR THE FLESHPOTS THE TASKMASTERS AND THE IDOLATRIES OF EGYPT THE OBJECT OF THE WARLIKE SAINTS WHO SURROUNDED CROMWELL WAS THE SETTLEMENT OF A FREE AND PIOUS COMMONWEALTH,12.055
46-127996-0030,TO ESTABLISH BY THEIR AID A DICTATORSHIP SUCH AS NO KING HAD EVER EXERCISED BUT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THEIR AID WOULD BE AT ONCE WITHDRAWN FROM A RULER WHO EVEN UNDER STRICT CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS,12.685
46-127996-0031,THE KINGLY NAME AND DIGNITY THE SENTIMENTS OF CROMWELL WERE WIDELY DIFFERENT HE WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD BEEN,7.425
46-127996-0032,HE HAD DURING THE THIRTEEN YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED GONE THROUGH A POLITICAL EDUCATION OF NO COMMON KIND HE HAD BEEN A CHIEF ACTOR IN A SUCCESSION OF REVOLUTIONS HE HAD BEEN LONG THE SOUL AND AT LAST THE HEAD OF A PARTY,13.5
46-127996-0033,PACIFIED AND REGULATED KINGDOMS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE INDEED IF HIS NOTIONS HAD BEEN STILL THE SAME AS IN THE DAYS WHEN HIS MIND WAS PRINCIPALLY OCCUPIED BY HIS FIELDS AND HIS RELIGION AND WHEN THE GREATEST EVENTS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE WERE A CATTLE FAIR,15.74
46-127996-0034,OR A PRAYER MEETING AT HUNTINGDON HE SAW THAT SOME SCHEMES OF INNOVATION FOR WHICH HE HAD ONCE BEEN ZEALOUS WHETHER GOOD OR BAD IN THEMSELVES WERE OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL FEELING OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT IF HE PERSEVERED IN THOSE SCHEMES HE HAD NOTHING BEFORE HIM,15.385
46-127996-0035,BUT CONSTANT TROUBLES WHICH MUST BE SUPPRESSED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THE SWORD HE THEREFORE WISHED TO RESTORE IN ALL ESSENTIALS THAT ANCIENT CONSTITUTION WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND FOR WHICH THEY NOW PINED,14.795
46-127996-0036,THE COURSE AFTERWARDS TAKEN BY MONK WAS NOT OPEN TO CROMWELL THE MEMORY OF ONE TERRIBLE DAY SEPARATED THE GREAT REGICIDE FOR EVER FROM THE HOUSE OF STUART WHAT REMAINED WAS THAT HE SHOULD MOUNT THE ANCIENT ENGLISH THRONE AND REIGN ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT ENGLISH POLITY,16.05
46-127996-0037,TO THE KINGLY OFFICE THAN TO KING CHARLES THE FIRST OR KING CHARLES THE SECOND WOULD SOON KISS THE HAND OF KING OLIVER THE PEERS WHO NOW REMAINED SULLENLY AT THEIR COUNTRY HOUSES,11.435
46-127996-0038,WOULD WHEN SUMMONED TO THEIR HOUSE BY THE WRIT OF A KING IN POSSESSION GLADLY RESUME THEIR ANCIENT FUNCTIONS NORTHUMBERLAND AND BEDFORD MANCHESTER AND PEMBROKE WOULD BE PROUD TO BEAR THE CROWN AND THE SPURS THE SCEPTRE AND THE GLOBE,14.975
46-127996-0039,BEFORE THE RESTORER OF ARISTOCRACY A SENTIMENT OF LOYALTY WOULD GRADUALLY BIND THE PEOPLE TO THE NEW DYNASTY AND,7.8
46-127996-0040,THE ROYAL DIGNITY MIGHT DESCEND WITH GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE TO HIS POSTERITY THE ABLEST ROYALISTS WERE OF OPINION THAT THESE VIEWS WERE CORRECT AND THAT IF CROMWELL HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO FOLLOW HIS OWN JUDGMENT THE EXILED LINE WOULD NEVER,15.76
46-127996-0041,HAVE BEEN RESTORED BUT HIS PLAN WAS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE FEELINGS OF THE ONLY CLASS WHICH HE DARED NOT OFFEND THE NAME OF KING WAS HATEFUL TO THE SOLDIERS SOME OF THEM WERE INDEED UNWILLING TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE HANDS OF ANY SINGLE PERSON,15.55
46-127996-0042,THE GREAT MAJORITY HOWEVER WERE DISPOSED TO SUPPORT THEIR GENERAL AS ELECTIVE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A COMMONWEALTH AGAINST ALL FACTIONS WHICH MIGHT RESIST HIS AUTHORITY,11.205
46-127996-0043,OR THAT THE DIGNITY WHICH WAS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PERSONAL MERIT SHOULD BE DECLARED HEREDITARY IN HIS FAMILY,7.14
46-127996-0044,AS THE ARMY WOULD BEAR THAT HIS ELEVATION TO POWER MIGHT NOT SEEM TO BE MERELY HIS OWN ACT HE CONVOKED A COUNCIL COMPOSED PARTLY OF PERSONS ON WHOSE SUPPORT HE COULD DEPEND AND PARTLY OF PERSONS WHOSE OPPOSITION HE MIGHT SAFELY DEFY,15.105
46-127996-0045,BUT IN A FEW YEARS HE THOUGHT IT SAFE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND TO RESTORE ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE ANCIENT SYSTEM UNDER HEW NAMES AND FORMS THE TITLE OF KING WAS NOT REVIVED,13.455
46-127996-0046,GIRT WITH A SWORD OF STATE CLAD IN A ROBE OF PURPLE AND PRESENTED WITH A RICH BIBLE IN WESTMINSTER HALL HIS OFFICE WAS NOT DECLARED HEREDITARY BUT HE WAS PERMITTED TO NAME HIS SUCCESSOR AND NONE COULD DOUBT THAT HE WOULD NAME HIS SON,15.64
46-127996-0047,A HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS A NECESSARY PART OF THE NEW POLITY IN CONSTITUTING THIS BODY THE PROTECTOR SHOWED A WISDOM AND A PUBLIC SPIRIT WHICH WERE NOT DULY APPRECIATED BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES,14.25
46-127996-0048,THE VICES OF THE OLD REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO SERIOUS AS THEY AFTERWARDS BECAME HAD ALREADY BEEN REMARKED BY FARSIGHTED MEN CROMWELL REFORMED THAT SYSTEM ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES ON WHICH MISTER PITT,14.55
46-127996-0049,VERY FEW UNREPRESENTED TOWNS HAD YET GROWN INTO IMPORTANCE OF THOSE TOWNS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE WERE MANCHESTER LEEDS AND HALIFAX REPRESENTATIVES WERE GIVEN TO ALL THREE,15.68
46-127996-0050,AN ADDITION WAS MADE TO THE NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS FOR THE CAPITAL THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE WAS PLACED ON SUCH A FOOTING THAT EVERY MAN OF SUBSTANCE WHETHER POSSESSED OF FREEHOLD ESTATES IN LAND OR NOT HAD A VOTE FOR THE COUNTY IN WHICH HE RESIDED,16.795
46-127996-0051,WERE SUMMONED TO THE ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS TO LEGISLATE AT WESTMINSTER FOR EVERY PART OF THE BRITISH ISLES TO CREATE A HOUSE OF LORDS WAS A LESS EASY TASK DEMOCRACY DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SUPPORT OF PRESCRIPTION,16.32
46-127996-0052,MONARCHY HAS OFTEN STOOD WITHOUT THAT SUPPORT BUT A PATRICIAN ORDER IS THE WORK OF TIME OLIVER FOUND ALREADY EXISTING A NOBILITY OPULENT HIGHLY CONSIDERED AND AS POPULAR WITH THE COMMONALTY,15.62
46-127996-0053,THAT HE OFFERED TO THE CHIEFS OF ILLUSTRIOUS FAMILIES SEATS IN HIS NEW SENATE THEY CONCEIVED THAT THEY COULD NOT ACCEPT A NOMINATION TO AN UPSTART ASSEMBLY,9.66
46-127996-0054,THE PROTECTOR WAS THEREFORE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF FILLING HIS UPPER HOUSE WITH NEW MEN WHO DURING THE LATE STIRRING TIMES HAD MADE THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS,11.465
46-127996-0055,HOW OLIVER'S PARLIAMENTS WERE CONSTITUTED HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY OF LITTLE MOMENT FOR HE POSSESSED THE MEANS OF CONDUCTING THE ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT AND IN DEFIANCE OF THEIR OPPOSITION,12.74
46-127996-0056,HIS WISH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TO GOVERN CONSTITUTIONALLY AND TO SUBSTITUTE THE EMPIRE OF THE LAWS FOR THAT OF THE SWORD BUT HE SOON FOUND THAT HATED AS HE WAS BOTH BY ROYALISTS AND PRESBYTERIANS,14.715
46-127996-0057,HE COULD BE SAFE ONLY BY BEING ABSOLUTE THE FIRST HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH THE PEOPLE ELECTED BY HIS COMMAND QUESTIONED HIS AUTHORITY AND WAS DISSOLVED WITHOUT HAVING PASSED A SINGLE ACT HIS SECOND HOUSE OF COMMONS,15.315
46-127996-0058,MODERATED ONLY BY THE WISDOM THE SOBRIETY AND THE MAGNANIMITY OF THE DESPOT THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED INTO MILITARY DISTRICTS THOSE DISTRICTS WERE PLACED UNDER THE COMMAND OF MAJOR GENERALS,15.15

46-127996-0063,WAS NOT HEAVY WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE NEIGHBOURING STATES AND WITH THE RESOURCES OF ENGLAND PROPERTY WAS SECURE EVEN THE CAVALIER WHO REFRAINED FROM GIVING DISTURBANCE TO THE NEW SETTLEMENT ENJOYED IN PEACE,14.37
46-127996-0064,WHATEVER THE CIVIL TROUBLES HAD LEFT HEM THE LAWS WERE VIOLATED ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE SAFETY OF THE PROTECTOR'S PERSON AND GOVERNMENT WAS CONCERNED JUSTICE WAS ADMINISTERED BETWEEN MAN AND MAN,14.93
46-127996-0065,HAD THERE BEEN SO LITTLE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THE UNFORTUNATE ROMAN CATHOLICS INDEED WERE HELD TO BE SCARCELY WITHIN THE PALE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY BUT THE CLERGY OF THE FALLEN ANGLICAN CHURCH,14.42
46-127996-0066,IN SPITE OF THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF JEALOUS TRADERS AND FANATICAL THEOLOGIANS PERMITTED TO BUILD A SYNAGOGUE IN LONDON,8.525
46-127996-0067,THAT THE TYRANT SUFFERED NONE BUT HIMSELF TO WRONG HIS COUNTRY AND THAT,4.62
46-127996-0068,HE HAD AT LEAST GIVEN HER GLORY IN EXCHANGE,2.995

46-127996-0072,UNLESS FAVOUR WERE SHOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD THE ENGLISH GUNS SHOULD BE HEARD IN THE CASTLE OF SAINT ANGELO IN TRUTH THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH CROMWELL HAD,11.41
46-127996-0073,UNHAPPILY FOR HIM HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF DISPLAYING HIS ADMIRABLE MILITARY TALENTS EXCEPT AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES WHILE HE LIVED HIS POWER STOOD FIRM AN OBJECT OF MINGLED AVERSION ADMIRATION,15.265

46-127996-0075,IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS MERITS BUT IT HAD MODERATION ENOUGH TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE OPPRESSIONS WHICH DRIVE MEN MAD AND IT HAD A FORCE AND ENERGY WHICH NONE BUT MEN DRIVEN MAD BY OPPRESSION WOULD VENTURE TO ENCOUNTER,15.7
46-128001-0000,THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COURT ABUSED ITS VICTORY MADE THE REMISSION SPEEDY AND COMPLETE EVERY MODERATE MAN WAS SHOCKED BY THE INSOLENCE CRUELTY AND PERFIDY WITH WHICH THE NONCONFORMISTS WERE TREATED,14.91
46-128001-0001,THE PENAL LAWS HAD EFFECTUALLY PURGED THE OPPRESSED PARTY OF THOSE INSINCERE MEMBERS WHOSE VICES HAD DISGRACED IT AND HAD MADE IT AGAIN AN HONEST AND PIOUS BODY OF MEN THE PURITAN A CONQUEROR,15.25

46-128001-0005,WHEN IT WAS NOISED ABROAD THAT THE COURT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO TREAT PAPISTS WITH THE SAME RIGOUR WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWN TO PRESBYTERIANS A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE KING AND THE DUKE WERE NOT SINCERE PROTESTANTS,14.15
46-128001-0006,SPRANG UP AND GATHERED STRENGTH MANY PERSONS TOO WHO HAD BEEN DISGUSTED BY THE AUSTERITY AND HYPOCRISY OF THE SAINTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH BEGAN TO BE STILL MORE DISGUSTED BY THE OPEN PROFLIGACY OF THE COURT AND OF THE CAVALIERS,15.71
46-128001-0007,AND WERE DISPOSED TO DOUBT WHETHER THE SULLEN PRECISENESS OF PRAISE GOD BAREBONE MIGHT NOT BE PREFERABLE TO THE OUTRAGEOUS PROFANENESS AND LICENTIOUSNESS OF THE BUCKINGHAMS AND SEDLEYS EVEN IMMORAL MEN,13.695
46-128001-0008,COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT TREATED THE MOST SERIOUS MATTERS AS TRIFLES AND MADE TRIFLES ITS SERIOUS BUSINESS A KING MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR AMUSING HIS LEISURE WITH WINE WIT AND BEAUTY BUT IT WAS INTOLERABLE,14.185
46-128001-0009,THAT HE SHOULD SINK INTO A MERE LOUNGER AND VOLUPTUARY THAT THE GRAVEST AFFAIRS OF STATE SHOULD BE NEGLECTED AND THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD BE STARVED AND THE FINANCES DERANGED IN ORDER THAT HARLOTS AND PARASITES MIGHT GROW RICH,15.28
46-128001-0010,A LARGE BODY OF ROYALISTS JOINED IN THESE COMPLAINTS AND ADDED MANY SHARP REFLECTIONS ON THE KING'S INGRATITUDE HIS WHOLE REVENUE INDEED WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICED TO REWARD THEM ALL IN PROPORTION TO THEIR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS OF DESERT,15.14
46-128001-0011,FOR TO EVERY DISTRESSED GENTLEMAN WHO HAD FOUGHT UNDER RUPERT OR DERBY HIS OWN SERVICES SEEMED EMINENTLY MERITORIOUS AND HIS OWN SUFFERINGS EMINENTLY SEVERE EVERY ONE HAD FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT WHATEVER BECAME OF THE REST,15.63
46-128001-0012,AND THAT THE RESTORATION OF THE MONARCHY WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE RESTORATION OF HIS OWN DILAPIDATED FORTUNES NONE OF THESE EXPECTANTS COULD RESTRAIN HIS INDIGNATION WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS AS POOR UNDER THE KING,13.88
46-128001-0013,AFTER CUTTING DOWN THEIR OAKS AND MELTING THEIR PLATE TO HELP HIS FATHER NOW WANDERED ABOUT IN THREADBARE SUITS AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR A MEAL AT THE SAME TIME A SUDDEN FALL OF RENTS TOOK PLACE,13.69
46-128001-0014,SAW WITH INDIGNATION THE INCREASING SPLENDOUR AND PROFUSION OF WHITEHALL AND WERE IMMOVABLY FIXED IN THE BELIEF THAT THE MONEY WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE SUPPORTED THEIR HOUSEHOLDS HAD BY SOME INEXPLICABLE PROCESS,13.87
46-128001-0015,GONE TO THE FAVOURITES OF THE KING THE MINDS OF MEN WERE NOW IN SUCH A TEMPER THAT EVERY PUBLIC ACT EXCITED DISCONTENT CHARLES HAD TAKEN TO WIFE CATHARINE PRINCESS OF PORTUGAL,12.83
46-128001-0016,THE MARRIAGE WAS GENERALLY DISLIKED AND THE MURMURS BECAME LOUD WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THE KING WAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE ANY LEGITIMATE POSTERITY DUNKIRK WON BY OLIVER FROM SPAIN WAS SOLD TO LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH KING OF FRANCE,15.415
46-128001-0017,HAD REGARDED THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA WAS IT WISE MEN ASKED AT SUCH A TIME TO MAKE ANY ADDITION TO THE STRENGTH OF A MONARCHY ALREADY TOO FORMIDABLE DUNKIRK WAS MOREOVER PRIZED BY THE PEOPLE,14.195
46-128001-0018,NOT MERELY AS A PLACE OF ARMS AND AS A KEY TO THE LOW COUNTRIES BUT ALSO AS A TROPHY OF ENGLISH VALOUR IT WAS TO THE SUBJECTS OF CHARLES WHAT CALAIS HAD BEEN TO AN EARLIER GENERATION AND WHAT THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR,13.715
46-128001-0019,BUT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THE CHARGES OF DUNKIRK FELL FAR SHORT OF THE SUMS WHICH WERE WASTED AT COURT IN VICE AND FOLLY IT SEEMED INSUPPORTABLE THAT A SOVEREIGN PROFUSE BEYOND EXAMPLE IN ALL THAT REGARDED HIS OWN PLEASURES,15.545
46-128001-0020,IT COULD IN NO WAY PROMOTE THE NATIONAL INTERESTS IT INVOLVED US IN INGLORIOUS UNPROFITABLE,6.24
46-128001-0021,SINGULARLY UNFAVOURABLE TO THE HEALTH AND VIGOUR OF THE ENGLISH RACE BUT THE MURMURS EXCITED BY THESE ERRORS WERE FAINT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CLAMOURS WHICH SOON BROKE FORTH THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGED IN WAR WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES,15.34
46-128001-0022,THE HOUSE OF COMMONS READILY VOTED SUMS UNEXAMPLED IN OUR HISTORY SUMS EXCEEDING THOSE WHICH HAD SUPPORTED THE FLEETS AND ARMIES OF CROMWELL AT THE TIME WHEN HIS POWER WAS THE TERROR OF ALL THE WORLD,13.245
46-128001-0023,ILL QUALIFIED TO CONTEND AGAINST THE GREAT MEN WHO THEN DIRECTED THE ARMS OF HOLLAND,5.755
46-128001-0024,WAS A TASK TOO HARD FOR THAT ADMINISTRATION,3.565
46-128001-0025,THE KING FEASTED WITH THE LADIES OF HIS SERAGLIO AND AMUSED HIMSELF WITH HUNTING A MOTH ABOUT THE SUPPER ROOM THEN AT LENGTH TARDY JUSTICE WAS DONE TO THE MEMORY OF OLIVER EVERYWHERE MEN MAGNIFIED HIS VALOUR,14.545
46-128001-0026,GENIUS AND PATRIOTISM EVERYWHERE IT WAS REMEMBERED HOW WHEN HE RULED ALL FOREIGN POWERS HAD TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF ENGLAND HOW THE STATES GENERAL NOW SO HAUGHTY HAD CROUCHED AT HIS FEET,13.795
46-128001-0027,AND HOW WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS NO MORE AMSTERDAM WAS LIGHTED UP AS FOR A GREAT DELIVERANCE AND CHILDREN RAN ALONG THE CANALS SHOUTING FOR JOY THAT THE DEVIL WAS DEAD EVEN ROYALISTS,14.705
46-128001-0028,EXCLAIMED THAT THE STATE COULD BE SAVED ONLY BY CALLING THE OLD SOLDIERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH TO ARMS SOON THE CAPITAL BEGAN TO FEEL THE MISERIES OF A BLOCKADE FUEL WAS SCARCELY TO BE PROCURED TILBURY FORT,14.32
46-128001-0029,THE PLACE WHERE ELIZABETH HAD WITH MANLY SPIRIT HURLED FOUL SCORN AT PARMA AND SPAIN WAS INSULTED BY THE INVADERS THE ROAR OF FOREIGN GUNS WAS HEARD,11.865
46-128001-0030,IF THE ENEMY ADVANCED THE TOWER SHOULD BE ABANDONED GREAT MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN THE STREETS CRYING OUT THAT ENGLAND WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD THE HOUSES AND CARRIAGES OF THE MINISTERS WERE ATTACKED BY THE POPULACE,14.845
46-128001-0031,AND IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO DEAL AT ONCE,3.94
46-128001-0032,A PESTILENCE SURPASSING IN HORROR ANY THAT DURING THREE CENTURIES HAD VISITED THE ISLAND SWEPT AWAY IN SIX MOUTHS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND HUMAN BEINGS AND SCARCELY HAD THE DEAD CART CEASED TO GO ITS ROUNDS,15.705
46-128001-0033,HAD THERE BEEN A GENERAL ELECTION WHILE THE NATION WAS SMARTING UNDER SO MANY DISGRACES AND MISFORTUNES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ROUNDHEADS WOULD HAVE REGAINED ASCENDENCY IN THE STATE BUT THE PARLIAMENT WAS STILL THE CAVALIER PARLIAMENT,14.485
46-128001-0034,ENCROACHING ON THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT THE GENTLEMEN WHO AFTER THE RESTORATION FILLED THE LOWER HOUSE THOUGH THEY ABHORRED THE PURITAN NAME,11.32
46-128001-0035,THE COMMONS ALONE COULD LEGALLY GRANT HIM MONEY THEY COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM PUTTING THEIR OWN PRICE ON THEIR GRANTS THE PRICE WHICH THEY PUT ON THEIR GRANTS WAS THIS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH EVERY ONE OF THE KING'S PREROGATIVES,15.33
46-128001-0036,TO WRING FROM HIM HIS CONSENT TO LAWS WHICH HE DISLIKED TO BREAK UP CABINETS TO DICTATE THE COURSE OF FOREIGN POLICY AND EVEN TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION OF WAR TO THE ROYAL OFFICE AND THE ROYAL PERSON THEY LOUDLY AND SINCERELY,15.785
46-128001-0037,PROFESSED THE STRONGEST ATTACHMENT BUT TO CLARENDON THEY OWED NO ALLEGIANCE AND THEY FELL ON HIM AS FURIOUSLY AS THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD FALLEN ON STRAFFORD THE MINISTER'S VIRTUES AND VICES ALIKE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS RUIN,15.045
46-128001-0038,HE WAS THE OSTENSIBLE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THEREFORE HELD RESPONSIBLE EVEN FOR THOSE ACTS WHICH HE HAD STRONGLY BUT VAINLY OPPOSED IN COUNCIL HE WAS REGARDED BY THE PURITANS,13.79
46-128001-0039,AND BY ALL WHO PITIED THEM AS AN IMPLACABLE BIGOT,3.405
46-128001-0040,WHO WISHED TO REPAIR THEIR RUINED FORTUNES,2.75
46-128001-0041,THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE DOWNFALL OF THEIR CHURCH THE PAPISTS OF IRELAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE LOSS OF THEIR LANDS AS FATHER OF THE DUCHESS OF YORK,12.73
46-128001-0042,HE HAD AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR WISHING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BARREN QUEEN AND HE WAS THEREFORE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PURPOSELY RECOMMENDED ONE THE SALE OF DUNKIRK WAS JUSTLY IMPUTED TO HIM,12.635
46-128001-0043,FOR THE WAR WITH HOLLAND HE WAS WITH LESS JUSTICE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HIS HOT TEMPER HIS ARROGANT DEPORTMENT THE INDELICATE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE GRASPED AT RICHES THE OSTENTATION WITH WHICH HE SQUANDERED THEM,15.63
46-128001-0044,HIS PICTURE GALLERY FILLED WITH MASTERPIECES OF VANDYKE WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN THE PROPERTY OF RUINED CAVALIERS HIS PALACE WHICH REARED ITS LONG AND STATELY FRONT RIGHT OPPOSITE TO THE HUMBLER RESIDENCE OF OUR KINGS,15.04
46-128001-0045,DREW ON HIM MUCH DESERVED AND SOME UNDESERVED CENSURE,4.2
46-128001-0046,THAT THE RAGE OF THE POPULACE WAS CHIEFLY DIRECTED HIS WINDOWS WERE BROKEN THE TREES OF HIS GARDEN WERE CUT DOWN AND A GIBBET WAS SET UP BEFORE HIS DOOR BUT NOWHERE WAS HE MORE DETESTED THAN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,14.935
46-128001-0047,HE WAS UNABLE TO PERCEIVE THAT THE TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING WHEN THAT HOUSE IF IT CONTINUED TO EXIST AT ALL MUST BE SUPREME IN THE STATE WHEN THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT HOUSE WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS AND WHEN,15.815
46-128001-0048,DISGUSTED AND ALARMED HIM NOTHING WOULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO PUT THE GREAT SEAL TO A WRIT FOR RAISING SHIPMONEY OR TO GIVE HIS VOICE IN COUNCIL FOR COMMITTING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO THE TOWER ON ACCOUNT OF WORDS SPOKEN IN DEBATE,15.8
46-128001-0049,BUT BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN THE CLOSET HE ON EVERY OCCASION EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN THAT GENTLEMEN SO SINCERELY ATTACHED TO MONARCHY SHOULD UNADVISEDLY ENCROACH ON THE PREROGATIVE OF THE MONARCH,12.985
46-128001-0050,WIDELY AS THEY DIFFERED IN SPIRIT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT THEY YET HE SAID IMITATED THAT PARLIAMENT IN MEDDLING WITH MATTERS WHICH LAY BEYOND THE SPHERE OF THE ESTATES OF THE REALM,12.605
46-128001-0051,AND WHICH WERE SUBJECT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN ALONE THE COUNTRY HE MAINTAINED WOULD NEVER BE WELL GOVERNED TILL THE KNIGHTS OF SHIRES AND THE BURGESSES WERE CONTENT TO BE WHAT THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD BEEN IN THE DAYS OF ELIZABETH,15.63
46-128001-0052,INCONSISTENT WITH THE OLD POLITY OF ENGLAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG ORATORS WHO WERE RISING TO DISTINCTION AND AUTHORITY IN THE LOWER HOUSE HIS DEPORTMENT WAS UNGRACIOUS AND HE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THEM WITH SCARCELY AN EXCEPTION,15.375
46-128001-0053,HIS DEADLY ENEMIES INDEED ONE OF HIS MOST SERIOUS FAULTS WAS AN INORDINATE CONTEMPT FOR YOUTH AND THIS CONTEMPT WAS THE MORE UNJUSTIFIABLE,10.75
46-128001-0054,FOR SO GREAT A PART OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED ABROAD THAT HE KNEW LESS OF THAT WORLD IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF ON HIS RETURN THAN MANY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS SONS FOR THESE REASONS HE WAS DISLIKED BY THE COMMONS,14.12
46-128001-0055,FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS HE WAS EQUALLY DISLIKED BY THE COURT,4.145
46-128001-0056,EVEN WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG LAW STUDENT LIVING MUCH WITH MEN OF WIT AND PLEASURE HIS NATURAL GRAVITY AND HIS RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES HAD TO A GREAT EXTENT,10.105
46-128001-0057,IN ADVANCED YEARS AND IN DECLINING HEALTH TO TURN LIBERTINE ON THE VICES OF THE YOUNG AND GAY HE LOOKED WITH AN AVERSION ALMOST AS BITTER AND CONTEMPTUOUS AS THAT WHICH HE FELT FOR THE THEOLOGICAL ERRORS OF THE SECTARIES,15.32
46-128001-0058,HE MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HIS SCORN OF THE MIMICS,4.06
46-128001-0059,THE CHANCELLOR FELL WITH A GREAT RUIN THE SEAL WAS TAKEN FROM HIM THE COMMONS IMPEACHED HIM HIS HEAD WAS NOT SAFE HE FLED FROM THE COUNTRY AN ACT WAS PASSED WHICH DOOMED HIM TO PERPETUAL EXILE,14.97
46-128001-0060,AND THOSE WHO HAD ASSAILED AND UNDERMINED HIM BEGAN TO STRUGGLE FOR THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS POWER,6.1
46-128001-0061,TOOK OFF THE EDGE OF THE PUBLIC APPETITE FOR REVENGE YET WAS THE ANGER EXCITED BY THE PROFUSION AND NEGLIGENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND BY THE MISCARRIAGES OF THE LATE WAR BY NO MEANS EXTINGUISHED THE COUNSELLORS OF CHARLES,15.21
46-128001-0062,WITH THE FATE OF THE CHANCELLOR BEFORE THEIR EYES WERE ANXIOUS FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY THEY ACCORDINGLY ADVISED THEIR MASTER TO SOOTHE THE IRRITATION WHICH PREVAILED BOTH IN THE PARLIAMENT AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND FOR THAT END,13.935
46-128001-0063,TO TAKE A STEP WHICH HAS NO PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF STUART,3.955

47-122796-0008,AS THEN SHE IS SURE OF HAVING IT DONE PROPERLY THEY WERE TELLING EACH OTHER WITH A CONFIDENTIAL INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DURING THE DAY THE MESSENGER OF FORTUNE HAD ONLY EXECUTED A FEW UNIMPORTANT COMMISSIONS SUCH AS SAVING A NEW BONNET FROM A SHOWER OF RAIN ET CETERA,13.91
47-122796-0009,BUT WHAT SHE HAD YET TO PERFORM WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL I MUST TELL YOU SAID SHE,5.935

47-122796-0028,I AM FAR FROM WELL SIGHED HE AND YET I DRANK ONLY ONE GLASS OF PUNCH BUT I CANNOT SUPPOSE IT IT WAS TOO REALLY VERY WRONG TO GIVE US PUNCH AND HOT SALMON FOR SUPPER,12.135
47-122796-0029,BUT NO THAT WOULD BE TOO SILLY AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS IF THEY ARE UP STILL HE LOOKED FOR THE HOUSE BUT IT HAD VANISHED IT IS REALLY DREADFUL GROANED HE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY I CANNOT RECOGNISE EAST STREET AGAIN,14.205

47-122796-0034,THE WOMAN EXAMINED HIM WITH EYES OF ASTONISHMENT AND SHOOK HER HEAD SHE THEN ADDRESSED HIM IN GERMAN THE COUNCILLOR THOUGHT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND DANISH AND THEREFORE REPEATED HIS WISH IN GERMAN THIS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS COSTUME STRENGTHENED THE GOOD WOMAN IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER,14.895
47-122796-0035,THAT HE WAS ILL SHE COMPREHENDED DIRECTLY SO SHE BROUGHT HIM A PITCHER OF WATER WHICH TASTED CERTAINLY PRETTY STRONG OF THE SEA ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN FETCHED FROM THE WELL THE COUNCILLOR SUPPORTED HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND DREW A LONG BREATH AND THOUGHT OVER ALL THE WONDROUS THINGS HE SAW AROUND HIM,15.935
47-122796-0036,HE ASKED MECHANICALLY AS HE SAW THE HOSTESS PUSH ASIDE A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER THE MEANING OF THIS COUNCILLORSHIP QUERY REMAINED OF COURSE A RIDDLE TO HER YET SHE HANDED HIM THE PAPER WITHOUT REPLYING IT WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT REPRESENTING A SPLENDID METEOR,14.765

47-122796-0039,THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE SITTING NEAREST HIM AND HEARD HIS SPEECH STARED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT AND ONE OF THEM ROSE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY AND SAID WITH A SERIOUS COUNTENANCE YOU ARE NO DOUBT A VERY LEARNED MAN MONSIEUR,12.18
47-122796-0040,AS INDEED ONE MUST DO ACCORDING TO THE DEMANDS OF THE WORLD AT PRESENT,3.885

47-122796-0047,THE COUNCILLOR IMAGINED IT WAS THE CHOLERA THAT WAS MEANT WHICH PEOPLE MADE SO MUCH FUSS ABOUT AND THE DISCOURSE PASSED OFF SATISFACTORILY ENOUGH,7.745
47-122796-0048,THE ENGLISH PIRATES HAD THEY SAID MOST SHAMEFULLY TAKEN THEIR SHIPS WHILE IN THE ROADSTEAD AND THE COUNCILLOR BEFORE WHOSE EYES THE HEROSTRATIC EVENT OF EIGHTEEN O ONE STILL FLOATED VIVIDLY,10.34
47-122796-0049,THEY POURED OUT THE LIQUOR AND MADE THE MOST FRIENDLY GESTICULATIONS WHILE A COLD PERSPIRATION TRICKLED DOWN THE BACK OF THE POOR COUNCILLOR WHAT'S TO BE THE END OF THIS WHAT'S TO BECOME OF ME,11.01
47-122796-0050,THEY TOOK HOLD OF THE WORTHY MAN WHO HEARING ON EVERY SIDE THAT HE WAS INTOXICATED,4.615
47-122796-0051,THEY HOWEVER IMAGINED HE WAS TALKING RUSSIAN NEVER BEFORE HE THOUGHT HAD HE BEEN IN SUCH A COARSE AND IGNORANT COMPANY,7.06
47-122796-0052,IS THE MOST DREADFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE THE WHOLE WORLD IS LEAGUED AGAINST ME,4.44
47-122796-0053,HE DID SO BUT JUST AS HE WAS GOING THE OTHERS REMARKED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT THEY LAID HOLD OF HIM BY THE LEGS AND NOW HAPPILY FOR HIM OFF FELL HIS FATAL SHOES AND WITH THEM THE CHARM WAS AT AN END,11.43
47-122796-0054,ALL SEEMED TO HIM IN PROPER ORDER AS USUAL IT WAS EAST STREET SPLENDID AND ELEGANT AS WE NOW SEE IT HE LAY WITH HIS FEET TOWARDS A DOORWAY AND EXACTLY OPPOSITE SAT THE WATCHMAN ASLEEP GRACIOUS HEAVEN SAID HE HAVE I LAIN HERE IN THE STREET AND DREAMED,14.71
47-122796-0055,YES TIS EAST STREET HOW SPLENDID AND LIGHT IT IS BUT REALLY IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT AN EFFECT THAT ONE GLASS OF PUNCH MUST HAVE HAD ON ME,8.185
47-122796-0056,HE THOUGHT OF THE DISTRESS AND AGONY HE HAD ENDURED AND PRAISED FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS HEART THE HAPPY REALITY OUR OWN TIME WHICH WITH ALL ITS DEFICIENCIES IS YET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT IN WHICH SO MUCH AGAINST HIS INCLINATION HE HAD LATELY BEEN THREE,15.46
47-122796-0057,THE WATCHMAN'S ADVENTURE WHY THERE IS A PAIR OF GALOSHES AS SURE AS I'M ALIVE SAID THE WATCHMAN AWAKING FROM A GENTLE SLUMBER THEY BELONG NO DOUBT TO THE LIEUTENANT WHO LIVES OVER THE WAY THEY LIE CLOSE TO THE DOOR,13.635
47-122796-0058,THE WORTHY MAN WAS INCLINED TO RING AND DELIVER THEM AT THE HOUSE FOR THERE WAS STILL A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW,4.875
47-122796-0059,SUCH A PAIR OF SHOES MUST BE VERY WARM AND COMFORTABLE SAID HE THE LEATHER IS SO SOFT AND SUPPLE THEY FITTED HIS FEET AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIM TIS A CURIOUS WORLD WE LIVE IN CONTINUED HE SOLILOQUIZING,12.84
47-122796-0060,WOULD TO HEAVEN I COULD BUT CHANGE WITH HIM HOW HAPPY SHOULD I BE WHILE EXPRESSING HIS WISH THE CHARM OF THE SHOES WHICH HE HAD PUT ON BEGAN TO WORK THE WATCHMAN ENTERED INTO THE BEING AND NATURE OF THE LIEUTENANT,12.315
47-122796-0061,HE STOOD IN THE HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT AND HELD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS A SMALL SHEET OF ROSE COLORED PAPER ON WHICH SOME VERSES WERE WRITTEN WRITTEN INDEED BY THE OFFICER HIMSELF,9.535
47-122796-0062,AND IF ONE THEN MARKS DOWN ONE'S THOUGHTS POETRY IS PRODUCED,4.095
47-122796-0063,OH WERE I RICH OH WERE I RICH SUCH WAS MY WISH YEA SUCH WHEN HARDLY THREE FEET HIGH I LONGED FOR MUCH OH WERE I RICH AN OFFICER WERE I WITH SWORD AND UNIFORM AND PLUME SO HIGH,16.01
47-122796-0064,AND THE TIME CAME AND OFFICER WAS I BUT YET I GREW NOT RICH ALAS POOR ME HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MAN'S WANTS DOST SEE I SAT ONE EVENING SUNK IN DREAMS OF BLISS A MAID OF SEVEN YEARS OLD,15.415
47-122796-0065,GAVE ME A KISS I AT THAT TIME WAS RICH IN POESY AND TALES OF OLD THOUGH POOR AS POOR COULD BE BUT ALL SHE ASKED FOR WAS THIS POESY THEN WAS I RICH BUT NOT IN GOLD POOR ME,12.3
47-122796-0066,BUT I'M CONDEMNED TO SILENCE OH POOR ME AS THOU DOST KNOW WHO ALL MEN'S HEARTS CANST SEE OH WERE I RICH IN CALM AND PEACE OF MIND MY GRIEF YOU THEN WOULD NOT HERE WRITTEN FIND,13.655
47-122796-0067,O THOU TO WHOM I DO MY HEART DEVOTE OH READ THIS PAGE OF GLAD DAYS NOW REMOTE A DARK DARK TALE WHICH I TONIGHT DEVOTE DARK IS THE FUTURE NOW ALAS POOR ME HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MEN'S PAINS,15.27
47-122796-0068,DOST SEE SUCH VERSES AS THESE PEOPLE WRITE WHEN THEY ARE IN LOVE BUT NO MAN IN HIS SENSES EVER THINKS OF PRINTING THEM HERE ONE OF THE SORROWS OF LIFE IN WHICH THERE IS REAL POETRY GAVE ITSELF VENT NOT THAT BARREN GRIEF WHICH THE POET MAY ONLY HINT AT,15.85
47-122796-0069,BUT NEVER DEPICT IN ITS DETAIL MISERY AND WANT THAT ANIMAL NECESSITY IN SHORT TO SNATCH AT LEAST AT A FALLEN LEAF OF THE BREAD FRUIT TREE IF NOT AT THE FRUIT ITSELF THE HIGHER THE POSITION IN WHICH ONE FINDS ONESELF TRANSPLANTED THE GREATER IS THE SUFFERING,16.035
47-122796-0070,EVERYDAY NECESSITY IS THE STAGNANT POOL OF LIFE NO LOVELY PICTURE REFLECTS ITSELF THEREIN LIEUTENANT LOVE AND LACK OF MONEY THAT IS A SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE OR MUCH THE SAME AS THE HALF OF THE SHATTERED DIE OF FORTUNE,13.43
47-122796-0071,THIS THE LIEUTENANT FELT MOST POIGNANTLY AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND SIGHED SO DEEPLY,7.49
47-122796-0072,HE HAS A HOME A WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO WEEP WITH HIM OVER HIS SORROWS WHO REJOICE WITH HIM WHEN HE IS GLAD,6.65
47-122796-0073,OH HE IS A HUNDRED TIMES HAPPIER THAN I,3.4
47-122796-0074,HE TOOK UPON HIM THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE OFFICER BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN HE FELT HIMSELF IN HIS NEW SITUATION MUCH LESS CONTENTED AND NOW PREFERRED THE VERY THING WHICH BUT SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE HAD REJECTED SO THEN THE WATCHMAN WAS AGAIN WATCHMAN,13.72
47-122796-0075,THAT WAS AN UNPLEASANT DREAM SAID HE BUT TWAS DROLL ENOUGH ALTOGETHER,4.475
47-122796-0076,I MISSED MY GOOD OLD MOTHER AND THE DEAR LITTLE ONES WHO ALMOST TEAR ME TO PIECES FOR SHEER LOVE HE SEATED HIMSELF ONCE MORE AND NODDED THE DREAM CONTINUED TO HAUNT HIM FOR HE STILL HAD THE SHOES ON HIS FEET A FALLING STAR SHONE IN THE DARK FIRMAMENT,13.85
47-122796-0077,THERE FALLS ANOTHER STAR SAID HE BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER THERE ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH LEFT I SHOULD NOT MUCH MIND EXAMINING THE LITTLE GLIMMERING THINGS SOMEWHAT NEARER ESPECIALLY THE MOON FOR THAT WOULD NOT SLIP SO EASILY THROUGH A MAN'S FINGERS WHEN WE DIE,14.655
47-122796-0078,WE SHALL FLY ABOUT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER FROM ONE SUCH A STAR TO THE OTHER THAT'S OF COURSE NOT TRUE BUT TWOULD BE PRETTY ENOUGH IF IT WERE SO IF I COULD BUT ONCE TAKE A LEAP UP THERE MY BODY MIGHT STAY HERE ON THE STEPS FOR WHAT I CARE,14.35
47-122796-0079,BUT DOUBLY CAREFUL MUST ONE BE WHEN WE HAVE THE SHOES OF FORTUNE ON OUR FEET NOW JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATCHMAN,6.655
47-122796-0080,EVERY INCH A MAN RESEMBLING THE REAL PERSONAGES EVEN TO THE FINEST FEATURES AND BECOME THE HEROES OR HEROINES OF OUR WORLD OF DREAMS IN REALITY SUCH REMEMBRANCES ARE RATHER UNPLEASANT EVERY SIN EVERY EVIL THOUGHT MAY LIKE A CLOCK WITH ALARM OR CHIMES,15.98
47-122796-0081,BE REPEATED AT PLEASURE THEN THE QUESTION IS IF WE CAN TRUST OURSELVES TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF EVERY UNBECOMING WORD IN OUR HEART AND ON OUR LIPS,7.985
47-122796-0082,THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WERE INFORMED OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE PEOPLE TALKED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT IT AND IN THE MORNING THE BODY WAS CARRIED TO THE HOSPITAL NOW THAT WOULD BE A VERY PRETTY JOKE IF THE SPIRIT WHEN IT CAME BACK AND LOOKED FOR THE BODY IN EAST STREET WERE NOT TO FIND ONE,14.135
47-122796-0083,NO DOUBT IT WOULD IN ITS ANXIETY RUN OFF TO THE POLICE AND THEN TO THE HUE AND CRY OFFICE TO ANNOUNCE THAT,6.495
47-122796-0084,YET WE MAY BOLDLY ASSERT THAT THE SOUL IS SHREWDEST WHEN IT SHAKES OFF EVERY FETTER AND EVERY SORT OF LEADING STRING THE BODY ONLY MAKES IT STUPID THE SEEMINGLY DEAD BODY OF THE WATCHMAN WANDERED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE HOSPITAL,13.21
47-122796-0085,AND THE FIRST THING THAT WAS DONE HERE WAS NATURALLY TO PULL OFF THE GALOSHES WHEN THE SPIRIT THAT WAS MERELY GONE OUT ON ADVENTURES MUST HAVE RETURNED WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LIGHTNING TO ITS EARTHLY TENEMENT IT TOOK ITS DIRECTION TOWARDS THE BODY IN A STRAIGHT LINE,13.175
47-122796-0086,AND A FEW SECONDS AFTER LIFE BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF IN THE MAN HE ASSERTED THAT THE PRECEDING NIGHT HAD BEEN THE WORST THAT EVER THE MALICE OF FATE HAD ALLOTTED HIM HE WOULD NOT FOR TWO SILVER MARKS AGAIN GO THROUGH WHAT HE HAD ENDURED WHILE MOON STRICKEN BUT NOW HOWEVER IT WAS OVER,15.14
47-122796-0087,BUT THE SHOES MEANWHILE REMAINED BEHIND FOUR A MOMENT OF HEAD IMPORTANCE AN EVENING'S DRAMATIC READINGS A MOST STRANGE JOURNEY EVERY INHABITANT OF COPENHAGEN KNOWS FROM PERSONAL INSPECTION HOW THE ENTRANCE TO FREDERICK'S HOSPITAL LOOKS,16.24
47-122796-0088,MAY ALSO READ THIS LITTLE WORK WE WILL BEFOREHAND GIVE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF IT THE EXTENSIVE BUILDING IS SEPARATED FROM THE STREET BY A PRETTY HIGH RAILING THE THICK IRON BARS OF WHICH ARE SO FAR APART THAT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,13.44
47-122796-0089,THE PART OF THE BODY MOST DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ON SUCH OCCASIONS WAS NO DOUBT THE HEAD,4.57
47-122796-0090,LONG HEADED PEOPLE GET THROUGH BEST SO MUCH THEN FOR THE INTRODUCTION ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOSE HEAD IN A PHYSICAL SENSE ONLY MIGHT BE SAID TO BE OF THE THICKEST,9.57
47-122796-0091,HAD THE WATCH THAT EVENING THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS YET DESPITE THESE TWO OBSTACLES THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT IF IT WERE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND AS TO TELLING THE DOOR KEEPER ABOUT IT THAT HE THOUGHT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY,13.475
47-122796-0092,IF WITH A WHOLE SKIN HE WERE ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH THE RAILINGS THERE ON THE FLOOR LAY THE GALOSHES WHICH THE WATCHMAN HAD FORGOTTEN HE NEVER DREAMED FOR A MOMENT THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF FORTUNE,11.03
47-122796-0093,SO HE PUT THEM ON THE QUESTION NOW WAS IF HE COULD SQUEEZE HIMSELF THROUGH THE GRATING FOR HE HAD NEVER TRIED BEFORE WELL THERE HE STOOD WOULD TO HEAVEN I HAD GOT MY HEAD THROUGH SAID HE INVOLUNTARILY,13.84
47-122796-0094,AND INSTANTLY THROUGH IT SLIPPED EASILY AND WITHOUT PAIN NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS PRETTY LARGE AND THICK BUT NOW THE REST OF THE BODY WAS TO BE GOT THROUGH AH I AM MUCH TOO STOUT GROANED HE ALOUD WHILE FIXED AS IN A VICE,13.66
47-122796-0095,OH OH I REALLY CANNOT SQUEEZE MYSELF THROUGH HE NOW WANTED TO PULL HIS OVER HASTY HEAD BACK AGAIN BUT HE COULD NOT FOR HIS NECK THERE WAS ROOM ENOUGH BUT FOR NOTHING MORE HIS FIRST FEELING WAS OF ANGER HIS NEXT THAT HIS TEMPER FELL TO ZERO,15.365
47-122796-0096,THE SHOES OF FORTUNE HAD PLACED HIM IN THE MOST DREADFUL SITUATION AND UNFORTUNATELY IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM TO WISH HIMSELF FREE THE PITCH BLACK CLOUDS POURED DOWN THEIR CONTENTS IN STILL HEAVIER TORRENTS NOT A CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE STREETS TO REACH UP TO THE BELL WAS WHAT HE DID NOT LIKE,16.565
47-122796-0097,BESIDES HOW ASHAMED WOULD HE HAVE BEEN TO BE FOUND CAUGHT IN A TRAP LIKE AN OUTWITTED FOX HOW WAS HE TO TWIST HIMSELF THROUGH HE SAW CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HIS IRREVOCABLE DESTINY TO REMAIN A PRISONER TILL DAWN OR PERHAPS EVEN LATE IN THE MORNING,14.745
47-122796-0098,THEN THE SMITH MUST BE FETCHED TO FILE AWAY THE BARS BUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT BE DONE SO QUICKLY AS HE COULD THINK ABOUT IT THE WHOLE CHARITY SCHOOL JUST OPPOSITE WOULD BE IN MOTION ALL THE NEW BOOTHS WITH THEIR NOT VERY COURTIER LIKE SWARM OF SEAMEN,14.13
47-122796-0099,WOULD JOIN THEM OUT OF CURIOSITY AND WOULD GREET HIM WITH A WILD HURRAH WHILE HE WAS STANDING IN HIS PILLORY THERE WOULD BE A MOB A HISSING AND REJOICING AND JEERING TEN TIMES WORSE THAN IN THE ROWS ABOUT THE JEWS SOME YEARS AGO,13.555
47-122796-0100,OH MY BLOOD IS MOUNTING TO MY BRAIN TIS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD I SHALL GO WILD I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO OH WERE I BUT LOOSE MY DIZZINESS WOULD THEN CEASE OH WERE MY HEAD BUT LOOSE,11.815
47-122796-0101,HE HASTENED OFF TO HIS ROOM WHERE THE PAINS CONSEQUENT ON THE FRIGHT THE SHOES HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DID NOT SO SOON TAKE THEIR LEAVE BUT YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT THE AFFAIR IS OVER NOW IT GROWS MUCH WORSE THE NIGHT PASSED THE NEXT DAY ALSO,15.56
47-122796-0102,BUT NOBODY CAME TO FETCH THE SHOES IN THE EVENING DRAMATIC READINGS WERE TO BE GIVEN AT THE LITTLE THEATRE IN KING STREET THE HOUSE WAS FILLED TO SUFFOCATION AND AMONG OTHER PIECES TO BE RECITED WAS A NEW POEM BY H C ANDERSEN CALLED MY AUNT'S SPECTACLES,16.275
47-122796-0103,THE CONTENTS OF WHICH WERE PRETTY NEARLY AS FOLLOWS A CERTAIN PERSON HAD AN AUNT WHO BOASTED OF PARTICULAR SKILL IN FORTUNE TELLING WITH CARDS AND WHO WAS CONSTANTLY BEING STORMED BY PERSONS THAT WANTED TO HAVE A PEEP INTO FUTURITY BUT SHE WAS FULL OF MYSTERY ABOUT HER ART,16.38
47-122796-0104,IN WHICH A CERTAIN PAIR OF MAGIC SPECTACLES DID HER ESSENTIAL SERVICE HER NEPHEW A MERRY BOY WHO WAS HIS AUNT'S DARLING BEGGED SO LONG FOR THESE SPECTACLES THAT AT LAST SHE LENT HIM THE TREASURE AFTER HAVING INFORMED HIM WITH MANY EXHORTATIONS,14.61
47-122796-0105,THAT IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE INTERESTING TRICK HE NEED ONLY REPAIR TO SOME PLACE WHERE A GREAT MANY PERSONS WERE ASSEMBLED AND THEN FROM A HIGHER POSITION WHENCE HE COULD OVERLOOK THE CROWD PASS THE COMPANY IN REVIEW BEFORE HIM THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES IMMEDIATELY,14.025
47-122796-0106,YET WITHOUT EXPRESSING HIS OPINION OPENLY HE TELLS THE PEOPLE ENOUGH TO SET THEM ALL THINKING AND GUESSING BUT IN ORDER TO HURT NOBODY HE WRAPS HIS WITTY ORACULAR JUDGMENTS IN A TRANSPARENT VEIL OR RATHER IN A LURID THUNDERCLOUD SHOOTING FORTH BRIGHT SPARKS OF WIT,15.02
47-122796-0107,THAT THEY MAY FALL IN THE POWDER MAGAZINE OF THE EXPECTANT AUDIENCE THE HUMOROUS POEM WAS ADMIRABLY RECITED AND THE SPEAKER MUCH APPLAUDED,9.15
47-122796-0108,HE HAD ON THE SHOES FOR AS YET NO LAWFUL OWNER HAD APPEARED TO CLAIM THEM AND BESIDES IT WAS SO VERY DIRTY OUT OF DOORS THEY WERE JUST THE THING FOR HIM HE THOUGHT THE BEGINNING OF THE POEM HE PRAISED WITH GREAT GENEROSITY HE EVEN FOUND THE IDEA ORIGINAL AND EFFECTIVE,14.475
47-122796-0109,BUT THAT THE END OF IT LIKE THE RHINE WAS VERY INSIGNIFICANT PROVED IN HIS OPINION THE AUTHOR'S WANT OF INVENTION HE WAS WITHOUT GENIUS ET CETERA THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SAID SOMETHING CLEVER MEANWHILE HE WAS HAUNTED BY THE IDEA,15.565
47-122796-0110,I CAN NOW SAID HE TO HIMSELF FANCY THE WHOLE ROW OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SITTING THERE IN THE FRONT ROW IF ONE COULD BUT SEE INTO THEIR HEARTS YES THAT WOULD BE A REVELATION A SORT OF BAZAR,11.55
47-122796-0111,IN THAT LADY YONDER SO STRANGELY DRESSED I SHOULD FIND FOR CERTAIN A LARGE MILLINER'S SHOP IN THAT ONE THE SHOP IS EMPTY BUT IT WANTS CLEANING PLAIN ENOUGH,9.12
47-122796-0112,ALAS SIGHED HE I KNOW ONE IN WHICH ALL IS STATELY BUT THERE SITS ALREADY A SPRUCE YOUNG SHOPMAN WHICH IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S AMISS IN THE WHOLE SHOP ALL WOULD BE SPLENDIDLY DECKED OUT AND WE SHOULD HEAR,12.745
47-122796-0113,WALK IN GENTLEMEN PRAY WALK IN HERE YOU WILL FIND ALL YOU PLEASE TO WANT AH I WISH TO HEAVEN I COULD WALK IN AND TAKE A TRIP RIGHT THROUGH THE HEARTS OF THOSE PRESENT AND BEHOLD TO THE SHOES OF FORTUNE THIS WAS THE CUE,13.56
47-122796-0114,THE FIRST HEART THROUGH WHICH HE CAME WAS THAT OF A MIDDLE AGED LADY BUT HE INSTANTLY FANCIED HIMSELF IN THE ROOM OF THE INSTITUTION FOR THE CURE OF THE CROOKED AND DEFORMED WHERE CASTS OF MIS SHAPEN LIMBS ARE DISPLAYED IN NAKED REALITY ON THE WALL,13.205
47-122796-0115,YET THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTITUTION THE CASTS WERE TAKEN AT THE ENTRY OF THE PATIENT,4.63
47-122796-0116,WHILE THE SOUND PERSONS WENT AWAY THEY WERE NAMELY CASTS OF FEMALE FRIENDS WHOSE BODILY OR MENTAL DEFORMITIES WERE HERE MOST FAITHFULLY PRESERVED WITH THE SNAKE LIKE WRITHINGS OF AN IDEA HE GLIDED INTO ANOTHER FEMALE HEART BUT THIS SEEMED TO HIM LIKE A LARGE HOLY FANE,16.17
47-122796-0117,THE WHITE DOVE OF INNOCENCE FLUTTERED OVER THE ALTAR HOW GLADLY WOULD HE HAVE SUNK UPON HIS KNEES BUT HE MUST AWAY TO THE NEXT HEART,7.54
47-122796-0118,WITH A SICK BED RID MOTHER REVEALED BUT GOD'S WARM SUN STREAMED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW LOVELY ROSES NODDED FROM THE WOODEN FLOWER BOXES ON THE ROOF,9.8299375
47-122796-0119,WHOSE NAME IS CERTAIN TO BE FOUND IN THE DIRECTORY,2.73
47-122796-0120,THE HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT WAS USED AS A WEATHER COCK WHICH WAS CONNECTED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER WITH THE DOORS AND SO THEY OPENED AND SHUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WHENEVER THE STERN OLD HUSBAND TURNED ROUND HEREUPON HE WANDERED INTO A BOUDOIR FORMED ENTIRELY OF MIRRORS LIKE THE ONE IN CASTLE ROSENBURG,16.24
47-122796-0121,BUT HERE THE GLASSES MAGNIFIED TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE ON THE FLOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM SAT LIKE A DALAI LAMA THE INSIGNIFICANT SELF OF THE PERSON QUITE CONFOUNDED AT HIS OWN GREATNESS HE THEN IMAGINED HE HAD GOT INTO A NEEDLE CASE FULL OF POINTED NEEDLES OF EVERY SIZE,15.975
47-122796-0122,A MAN AS PEOPLE SAID OF TALENT AND FEELING IN THE GREATEST PERPLEXITY HE NOW CAME OUT OF THE LAST HEART IN THE ROW HE WAS UNABLE TO PUT HIS THOUGHTS IN ORDER AND FANCIED THAT HIS TOO LIVELY IMAGINATION HAD RUN AWAY WITH HIM,11.8
47-122796-0123,AND HE NOW REMEMBERED THE IMPORTANT EVENT OF THE EVENING BEFORE HOW HIS HEAD HAD GOT JAMMED IN BETWEEN THE IRON RAILINGS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT'S WHAT IT IS NO DOUBT SAID HE I MUST DO SOMETHING IN TIME UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUSSIAN BATH MIGHT DO ME GOOD,12.925
47-122796-0124,AND AS HE GETS ACCUSTOMED TO THE HEAT MOVES TO ANOTHER HIGHER UP TOWARDS THE CEILING WHERE OF COURSE THE VAPOR IS WARMEST IN THIS MANNER HE ASCENDS GRADUALLY TO THE HIGHEST AND SO THERE HE LAY ON THE UPPERMOST BANK IN THE VAPOR BATH,14.365
47-122796-0125,BUT WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES ON IN HIS BOOTS AND GALOSHES WHILE THE HOT DROPS FELL SCALDING FROM THE CEILING ON HIS FACE HOLLOA CRIED HE LEAPING DOWN THE BATHING ATTENDANT ON HIS SIDE UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE BEHELD IN THE BATH A MAN COMPLETELY DRESSED,15.335
47-122796-0126,THE OTHER HOWEVER RETAINED SUFFICIENT PRESENCE OF MIND TO WHISPER TO HIM TIS A BET AND I HAVE WON IT BUT THE FIRST THING HE DID AS SOON AS HE GOT HOME WAS TO HAVE A LARGE BLISTER PUT ON HIS CHEST AND BACK TO DRAW OUT HIS MADNESS,13.21
47-122796-0127,THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD A SORE CHEST AND A BLEEDING BACK AND EXCEPTING THE FRIGHT THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GAINED BY THE SHOES OF FORTUNE FIVE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE COPYING CLERK THE WATCHMAN,15.02
47-122796-0128,WHOM WE HAVE CERTAINLY NOT FORGOTTEN THOUGHT MEANWHILE OF THE GALOSHES HE HAD FOUND AND TAKEN WITH HIM TO THE HOSPITAL,5.675

57-121074-0020,AND IF THEY HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES TOWARDS YOU WITH ALL THE DEFERENCE DUE TO YOUR RANK FINALLY HE IS ANXIOUS TO SEE IF YOU HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ESCAPE THE BAD MORAL INFLUENCE TO WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND WHICH IS INFINITELY MORE TO BE DREADED THAN ANY PHYSICAL SUFFERING,15.085
57-121074-0021,HE WISHES TO DISCOVER IF THE FINE ABILITIES WITH WHICH NATURE HAD ENDOWED YOU HAVE BEEN WEAKENED BY WANT OF CULTURE AND IN SHORT WHETHER YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF CAPABLE OF RESUMING AND RETAINING IN THE WORLD THE HIGH POSITION TO WHICH YOUR RANK ENTITLES YOU,13.72

57-121074-0037,AND FOR A MAN OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE THIS PLAN IS AS EASY AS IT IS NECESSARY YOU MUST FORM HONORABLE FRIENDSHIPS AND BY THAT MEANS COUNTERACT THE PREJUDICE WHICH MAY ATTACH TO THE OBSCURITY OF YOUR FORMER LIFE ANDREA VISIBLY CHANGED COUNTENANCE,15.56

57-121074-0097,WE WILL BE WITH YOU AT THAT TIME SAID THE MAJOR,2.805
57-121742-0000,ONE GLORIOUS MORNING IN EARLY SUMMER I FOUND MYSELF LED BY THE UNGENTLE HAND OF MISSUS MITCHELL TOWARDS A LITTLE SCHOOL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VILLAGE KEPT BY AN OLD WOMAN CALLED MISSUS SHAND IN AN ENGLISH VILLAGE I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED DAME SHAND,14.625
57-121742-0001,WE CALLED HER LUCKIE SHAND HALF DRAGGED ALONG THE ROAD BY MISSUS MITCHELL FROM WHOSE ROUGH GRASP I ATTEMPTED IN VAIN TO EXTRICATE MY HAND I LOOKED AROUND AT THE SHINING FIELDS AND UP AT THE BLUE SKY,11.025
57-121742-0002,WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE DESPAIR OF A MAN GOING TO THE GALLOWS AND BIDDING FAREWELL TO THE WORLD WE HAD TO CROSS A LITTLE STREAM AND WHEN WE REACHED THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOT BRIDGE I TUGGED YET AGAIN AT MY IMPRISONED HAND WITH A HALF FORMED INTENTION OF THROWING MYSELF INTO THE BROOK,15.52
57-121742-0003,BUT MY EFFORTS WERE STILL UNAVAILING OVER A HALF MILE OR SO RENDERED WEARY BY UNWILLINGNESS I WAS LED TO THE COTTAGE DOOR,7.71
57-121742-0004,BUT A DREARY LITTLE HOUSE WITH NOTHING GREEN TO COVER THE BROWN STONES OF WHICH IT WAS BUILT AND HAVING AN OPEN DITCH IN FRONT OF IT WITH A STONE SLAB OVER IT FOR A BRIDGE DID I SAY THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE WALLS THIS MORNING THERE WAS THE LOVELIEST SUNSHINE,14.745
57-121742-0005,AND THAT I WAS GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND IT WAS VERY BITTER ESPECIALLY AS I HAD EXPECTED TO GO WITH MY ELDER BROTHER TO SPEND THE DAY AT A NEIGHBOURING FARM MISSUS MITCHELL OPENED THE DOOR AND LED ME IN IT WAS AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE DAME SHAND STOOD AT HER TABLE IRONING,15.94
57-121742-0006,SHE WAS AS TALL AS MISSUS MITCHELL AND THAT WAS ENOUGH TO PREJUDICE ME AGAINST HER AT ONCE SHE WORE A CLOSE FITTING WIDOW'S CAP WITH A BLACK RIBBON ROUND IT HER HAIR WAS GREY AND HER FACE WAS AS GREY AS HER HAIR,12.27
57-121742-0007,AND HER SKIN WAS GATHERED IN WRINKLES ABOUT HER MOUTH WHERE THEY TWITCHED AND TWITCHED AS IF SHE WERE CONSTANTLY MEDITATING SOMETHING UNPLEASANT SHE LOOKED UP INQUIRINGLY I'VE BROUGHT YOU A NEW SCHOLAR SAID MISSUS MITCHELL WELL VERY WELL,15.58
57-121742-0008,SAID THE DAME IN A DUBIOUS TONE I HOPE HE'S A GOOD BOY FOR HE MUST BE GOOD IF HE COMES HERE WELL HE'S JUST MIDDLING HIS FATHER SPARES THE ROD MISSUS SHAND AND WE KNOW WHAT COMES OF THAT THEY WENT ON WITH THEIR TALK WHICH AS FAR AS I CAN RECALL IT,15.6
57-121742-0009,WAS COMPLIMENTARY TO NONE BUT THE TWO WOMEN THEMSELVES MEANTIME I WAS MAKING WHAT OBSERVATIONS MY TERROR WOULD ALLOW ABOUT A DOZEN CHILDREN WERE SEATED ON FORMS ALONG THE WALLS LOOKING OVER THE TOPS OF THEIR SPELLING BOOKS AT THE NEWCOMER,14.01
57-121742-0010,IN THE FARTHER CORNER TWO WERE KICKING AT EACH OTHER AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED LOOKING VERY ANGRY BUT NOT DARING TO CRY MY NEXT DISCOVERY WAS TERRIBLY DISCONCERTING SOME MOVEMENT DREW MY EYES TO THE FLOOR THERE I SAW A BOY OF MY OWN AGE ON ALL FOURS,15.35
57-121742-0011,FASTENED BY A STRING TO A LEG OF THE TABLE AT WHICH THE DAME WAS IRONING WHILE HORRIBLE TO RELATE A DOG NOT VERY BIG BUT VERY UGLY AND BIG ENOUGH TO BE FRIGHTENED AT LAY UNDER THE TABLE WATCHING HIM I GAZED IN UTTER DISMAY,15.615
57-121742-0012,AH YOU MAY LOOK SAID THE DAME IF YOU'RE NOT A GOOD BOY THAT IS HOW YOU SHALL BE SERVED THE DOG SHALL HAVE YOU TO LOOK AFTER I TREMBLED AND WAS SPEECHLESS AFTER SOME FURTHER CONFABULATION MISSUS MITCHELL TOOK HER LEAVE SAYING,14.53
57-121742-0013,I'LL COME BACK FOR HIM AT ONE O'CLOCK AND IF I DON'T COME JUST KEEP HIM TILL I DO COME THE DAME ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE DOOR AND THEN I DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS LAME AND HOBBLED VERY MUCH A RESOLUTION AROSE FULL FORMED IN MY BRAIN,15.275
57-121742-0014,I SAT DOWN ON THE FORM NEAR THE DOOR AND KEPT VERY QUIET HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTENTION I CHERISHED I AM SURE I SHOULD HAVE CRIED WHEN THE DAME RETURNED SHE RESUMED HER BOX IRON IN WHICH THE HEATER WENT RATTLING ABOUT,13.265
57-121742-0015,AS STANDING ON ONE LEG THE OTHER WAS SO MUCH SHORTER SHE MOVED IT TO AND FRO OVER THE GARMENT ON THE TABLE THEN SHE CALLED ME TO HER BY NAME IN A WOULD BE POMPOUS MANNER I OBEYED TREMBLING CAN YOU SAY YOUR LETTERS,15.555
57-121742-0016,SHE ASKED NOW ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT READ I COULD REPEAT THE ALPHABET HOW I HAD LEARNED IT I DO NOT KNOW I DID REPEAT IT HOW MANY QUESTIONS OF YOUR CATECHISM CAN YOU SAY SHE ASKED NEXT,13.475
57-121742-0017,NOT KNOWING WITH CERTAINTY WHAT SHE MEANT I WAS SILENT NO SULKING SAID THE DAME AND OPENING A DRAWER IN THE TABLE SHE TOOK OUT A CATECHISM TURNING BACK THE COVER SHE PUT IT IN MY HAND AND TOLD ME TO LEARN THE FIRST QUESTION,15.155
57-121742-0018,SHE HAD NOT EVEN INQUIRED WHETHER I COULD READ I TOOK THE CATECHISM AND STOOD AS BEFORE GO TO YOUR SEAT SHE SAID I OBEYED AND WITH THE BOOK BEFORE ME PONDERED MY PLAN,12.69
57-121742-0019,EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON WHETHER I COULD OPEN THE DOOR BEFORE SHE COULD REACH ME ONCE OUT OF THE HOUSE I WAS SURE OF RUNNING FASTER THAN SHE COULD FOLLOW AND SOON I HAD MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF HOW THOSE ARE HELPED WHO WILL HELP THEMSELVES,13.725
57-121742-0020,THE IRONING OF COURSE REQUIRED A FIRE TO MAKE THE IRONS HOT AND AS THE MORNING WENT ON THE SUNSHINE ON THE WALLS CONSPIRING WITH THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH MADE THE PLACE TOO HOT FOR THE COMFORT OF THE OLD DAME SHE WENT AND SET THE DOOR WIDE OPEN,14.405
57-121742-0021,I WAS INSTANTLY ON THE ALERT WATCHING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY ONE SOON OCCURRED A CLASS OF SOME FIVE OR SIX WAS READING IF READING IT COULD BE CALLED OUT OF THE BIBLE AT LENGTH IT CAME TO THE TURN OF ONE WHO BLUNDERED DREADFULLY,13.97
57-121742-0022,IT WAS THE SAME BOY WHO HAD BEEN TIED UNDER THE TABLE BUT HE HAD BEEN RELEASED FOR HIS LESSON THE DAME HOBBLED TO HIM AND FOUND HE HAD HIS BOOK UPSIDE DOWN WHEREUPON SHE TURNED IN WRATH TO THE TABLE AND TOOK FROM THE DRAWER A LONG LEATHER STRAP,14.54
57-121742-0023,WITH WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO CHASTISE HIM AS HIS FIRST CRY REACHED MY EARS I WAS HALFWAY TO THE DOOR ON THE THRESHOLD I STUMBLED AND FELL,8.58
57-121742-0024,I HEARD WITH HORROR BUT I WAS UP AND OFF IN A MOMENT I HAD NOT HOWEVER GOT MANY YARDS FROM THE COTTAGE BEFORE I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE DAME SCREAMING AFTER ME TO RETURN I TOOK NO HEED ONLY SPED THE FASTER,13.995
57-121742-0025,BUT WHAT WAS MY HORROR TO FIND HER COMMAND ENFORCED BY THE PURSUING BARK OF HER PRIME MINISTER THIS PARALYSED ME I TURNED AND THERE WAS THE FIENDISH LOOKING DOG CLOSE ON MY HEELS I COULD RUN NO LONGER,13.975
57-121742-0026,THE NEXT MOMENT A WHOLESOME RAGE SENT THE BLOOD TO MY BRAIN FROM ABJECT COWARDICE TO WILD ATTACK I CANNOT CALL IT COURAGE WAS THE CHANGE OF AN INSTANT I RUSHED TOWARDS THE LITTLE WRETCH I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIGHT HIM,13.76
57-121742-0027,BUT IN DESPERATION I THREW MYSELF UPON HIM AND DUG MY NAILS INTO HIM THEY HAD FORTUNATELY FOUND THEIR WAY TO HIS EYES HE WAS THE VERIEST COWARD OF HIS SPECIES HE YELPED AND HOWLED AND STRUGGLING FROM MY GRASP RAN WITH HIS TAIL MERGED IN HIS PERSON BACK TO HIS MISTRESS,16.065
57-121742-0028,WHO WAS HOBBLING AFTER ME BUT WITH THE RENEWED STRENGTH OF TRIUMPH I TURNED AGAIN FOR HOME AND RAN AS I HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE WHEN OR WHERE THE DAME GAVE IN I DO NOT KNOW,10.96
57-121742-0029,AND THERE I BURST OUT SOBBING AND CRYING IT WAS ALL THE UTTERANCE I HAD LEFT AS SOON AS KIRSTY HAD SUCCEEDED IN CALMING ME I TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY SHE SAID VERY LITTLE BUT I COULD SEE SHE WAS VERY ANGRY NO DOUBT SHE WAS PONDERING WHAT COULD BE DONE,15.4
57-121742-0030,SHE GOT ME SOME MILK HALF CREAM I DO BELIEVE IT WAS SO NICE AND SOME OATCAKE AND WENT ON WITH HER WORK WHILE I ATE I REFLECTED THAT ANY MOMENT MISSUS MITCHELL MIGHT APPEAR TO DRAG ME BACK IN DISGRACE TO THAT HORRIBLE DEN,13.24
57-121742-0031,I KNEW THAT KIRSTY'S AUTHORITY WAS NOT EQUAL TO HERS AND THAT SHE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO GIVE ME UP SO I WATCHED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE ONCE MORE AND HIDE MYSELF SO THAT KIRSTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS,13.185
57-121742-0032,WHEN I HAD FINISHED AND KIRSTY HAD LEFT THE KITCHEN FOR A MOMENT I SPED NOISELESSLY TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE FARMYARD THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN DARK AND BROWN AND COOL THE DOOR OF THE BARN STOOD OPEN AS IF INVITING ME TO SHELTER AND SAFETY,14.49
57-121742-0033,FOR I KNEW THAT IN THE DARKEST END OF IT LAY A GREAT HEAP OF OAT STRAW I SPED ACROSS THE INTERVENING SUNSHINE INTO THE DARKNESS AND BEGAN BURROWING IN THE STRAW LIKE A WILD ANIMAL DRAWING OUT HANDFULS AND LAYING THEM CAREFULLY ASIDE SO THAT NO DISORDER SHOULD BETRAY MY RETREAT,16.01
57-121742-0034,WHEN I HAD MADE A HOLE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ME I GOT IN BUT KEPT DRAWING OUT THE STRAW BEHIND ME AND FILLING THE HOLE IN FRONT THIS I CONTINUED UNTIL I HAD NOT ONLY STOPPED UP THE ENTRANCE BUT PLACED A GOOD THICKNESS OF STRAW BETWEEN ME AND THE OUTSIDE,14.835
57-121742-0035,BY THE TIME I HAD BURROWED AS FAR AS I THOUGHT NECESSARY I WAS TIRED AND LAY DOWN AT FULL LENGTH IN MY HOLE DELIGHTING IN SUCH A SENSE OF SAFETY AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED,10.645
58-121075-0000,HALF SCREENED FROM VIEW BY THE LARGE CHESTNUT TREES WHICH ON ALL SIDES SPREAD THEIR LUXURIANT BRANCHES WE SHALL FIND SOME PEOPLE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE THIS TIME MAXIMILIAN WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE,13.335
58-121075-0001,HE WAS INTENTLY WATCHING FOR A SHADOW TO APPEAR AMONG THE TREES AND AWAITING WITH ANXIETY THE SOUND OF A LIGHT STEP ON THE GRAVEL WALK AT LENGTH THE LONG DESIRED SOUND WAS HEARD AND INSTEAD OF ONE FIGURE AS HE HAD EXPECTED,14.505
58-121075-0002,HE PERCEIVED THAT TWO WERE APPROACHING HIM THE DELAY HAD BEEN OCCASIONED BY A VISIT FROM MADAME DANGLARS AND EUGENIE WHICH HAD BEEN PROLONGED BEYOND THE TIME AT WHICH VALENTINE WAS EXPECTED,12.07
58-121075-0003,SHE PROPOSED TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDEN BEING ANXIOUS TO SHOW THAT THE DELAY WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO HIM WAS NOT OCCASIONED BY ANY NEGLECT ON HER PART,13.745
58-121075-0004,THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTION OF A LOVER QUICKLY UNDERSTOOD THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SHE WAS INVOLUNTARILY PLACED AND HE WAS COMFORTED BESIDES ALTHOUGH SHE AVOIDED COMING WITHIN SPEAKING DISTANCE,14.07
58-121075-0005,VALENTINE ARRANGED SO THAT MAXIMILIAN COULD SEE HER PASS AND REPASS AND EACH TIME SHE WENT BY SHE MANAGED UNPERCEIVED BY HER COMPANION TO CAST AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK AT THE YOUNG MAN WHICH SEEMED TO SAY HAVE PATIENCE,15.435
58-121075-0006,YOU SEE IT IS NOT MY FAULT AND MAXIMILIAN WAS PATIENT AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN MENTALLY CONTRASTING THE TWO GIRLS ONE FAIR WITH SOFT LANGUISHING EYES A FIGURE GRACEFULLY BENDING LIKE A WEEPING WILLOW,14.895
58-121075-0007,THE OTHER A BRUNETTE WITH A FIERCE AND HAUGHTY EXPRESSION AND AS STRAIGHT AS A POPLAR IT IS UNNECESSARY TO STATE THAT IN THE EYES OF THE YOUNG MAN VALENTINE DID NOT SUFFER BY THE CONTRAST IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THE GIRLS WENT AWAY,16.625
58-121075-0008,AND MAXIMILIAN UNDERSTOOD THAT MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS VISIT HAD AT LAST COME TO AN END IN A FEW MINUTES VALENTINE RE ENTERED THE GARDEN ALONE FOR FEAR THAT ANY ONE SHOULD BE OBSERVING HER RETURN SHE WALKED SLOWLY,15.19
58-121075-0009,AND INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY DIRECTING HER STEPS TOWARDS THE GATE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A BENCH AND CAREFULLY CASTING HER EYES AROUND TO CONVINCE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WATCHED SHE PRESENTLY AROSE AND PROCEEDED QUICKLY TO JOIN MAXIMILIAN,15.295
58-121075-0010,GOOD EVENING VALENTINE SAID A WELL KNOWN VOICE GOOD EVENING MAXIMILIAN I KNOW I HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING BUT YOU SAW THE CAUSE OF MY DELAY YES I RECOGNIZED MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS,13.155
58-121075-0011,THAT WILL ACCOUNT TO YOU FOR THE UNRESERVED MANNER WHICH YOU OBSERVED BETWEEN ME AND EUGENIE AS IN SPEAKING OF THE MAN WHOM I COULD NOT LOVE MY THOUGHTS INVOLUNTARILY REVERTED TO HIM ON WHOM MY AFFECTIONS WERE FIXED,13.22
58-121075-0012,AH HOW GOOD YOU ARE TO SAY SO VALENTINE YOU POSSESS A QUALITY WHICH CAN NEVER BELONG TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS IT IS THAT INDEFINABLE CHARM WHICH IS TO A WOMAN WHAT PERFUME IS TO THE FLOWER AND FLAVOR TO THE FRUIT,14.195
58-121075-0013,FOR THE BEAUTY OF EITHER IS NOT THE ONLY QUALITY WE SEEK IT IS YOUR LOVE WHICH MAKES YOU LOOK UPON EVERYTHING IN THAT LIGHT NO VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I WAS OBSERVING YOU BOTH WHEN YOU WERE WALKING IN THE GARDEN,15.025
58-121075-0014,AND ON MY HONOR WITHOUT AT ALL WISHING TO DEPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY MAN CAN REALLY LOVE HER THE FACT IS MAXIMILIAN,11.065
58-121075-0015,THAT I WAS THERE AND MY PRESENCE HAD THE EFFECT OF RENDERING YOU UNJUST IN YOUR COMPARISON NO BUT TELL ME IT IS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY AND WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY CERTAIN IDEAS PASSING IN MY MIND RELATIVE,14.28
58-121075-0016,TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I DARE SAY IT IS SOMETHING DISPARAGING WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IT ONLY PROVES HOW LITTLE INDULGENCE WE MAY EXPECT FROM YOUR SEX INTERRUPTED VALENTINE YOU CANNOT AT LEAST DENY THAT YOU ARE VERY HARSH JUDGES OF EACH OTHER,15.305
58-121075-0017,IF WE ARE SO IT IS BECAUSE WE GENERALLY JUDGE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXCITEMENT BUT RETURN TO YOUR QUESTION DOES MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS OBJECT TO THIS MARRIAGE WITH M DE MORCERF ON ACCOUNT OF LOVING ANOTHER,13.64
58-121075-0018,I TOLD YOU I WAS NOT ON TERMS OF STRICT INTIMACY WITH EUGENIE YES BUT GIRLS TELL EACH OTHER SECRETS WITHOUT BEING PARTICULARLY INTIMATE OWN NOW THAT YOU DID QUESTION HER ON THE SUBJECT AH I SEE YOU ARE SMILING,13.59
58-121075-0019,IF YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED THE WOODEN PARTITION WHICH INTERPOSED BETWEEN US AND YOU HAS PROVED BUT A SLIGHT SECURITY COME WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE LOVED NO ONE SAID VALENTINE,14.825
58-121075-0020,YOU ARE THE SUBJECT ON WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TRUE WE MUST BE QUICK FOR WE HAVE SCARCELY TEN MINUTES MORE TO PASS TOGETHER MA FOI SAID MAXIMILIAN IN CONSTERNATION YES YOU ARE RIGHT I AM BUT A POOR FRIEND TO YOU,15.73
58-121075-0021,WELL WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY VALENTINE SO LONG AS I AM SATISFIED AND FEEL THAT EVEN THIS LONG AND PAINFUL SUSPENSE IS AMPLY REPAID BY FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR SOCIETY OR TWO WORDS FROM YOUR LIPS,12.53
58-121075-0022,AND I HAVE ALSO A DEEP CONVICTION THAT HEAVEN WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED TWO HEARTS HARMONIZING AS OURS DO AND ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY BROUGHT US TOGETHER TO SEPARATE US AT LAST THOSE ARE KIND AND CHEERING WORDS,14.15
58-121075-0023,BUT WHY MUST YOU LEAVE ME SO SOON I DO NOT KNOW PARTICULARS,5.05
58-121075-0024,AS SHE HAD A COMMUNICATION TO MAKE ON WHICH A PART OF MY FORTUNE DEPENDED LET THEM TAKE MY FORTUNE I AM ALREADY TOO RICH AND PERHAPS WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN IT THEY WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS,12.64
58-121075-0025,YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS MUCH IF I WERE POOR WOULD YOU NOT MAXIMILIAN OH I SHALL ALWAYS LOVE YOU WHAT SHOULD I CARE FOR EITHER RICHES OR POVERTY IF MY VALENTINE WAS NEAR ME AND I FELT CERTAIN THAT NO ONE COULD DEPRIVE ME OF HER,14.595
58-121075-0026,BUT DO YOU NOT FEAR THAT THIS COMMUNICATION MAY RELATE TO YOUR MARRIAGE I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CASE HOWEVER IT MAY BE VALENTINE YOU MUST NOT BE ALARMED,11.47
58-121075-0027,WELL MONSIEUR FRANZ IS HIS FRIEND YOU KNOW WHAT THEN MONSIEUR DE MORCERF HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FRANZ ANNOUNCING HIS IMMEDIATE RETURN VALENTINE TURNED PALE AND LEANED HER HAND AGAINST THE GATE,15.235
58-121075-0028,WHY NOT BECAUSE I SCARCELY KNOW WHY,4.44
58-121075-0029,NOT BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO DO THAT SAID VALENTINE WITH A SAD SMILE IF SHE OBJECTS TO YOUR MARRYING M D'EPINAY SHE WOULD BE ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO ANY OTHER PROPOSITION NO MAXIMILIAN IT IS NOT SUITORS TO WHICH MADAME DE VILLEFORT OBJECTS,16.19
58-121075-0030,IT IS MARRIAGE ITSELF MARRIAGE IF SHE DISLIKES THAT SO MUCH WHY DID SHE EVER MARRY HERSELF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME MAXIMILIAN ABOUT A YEAR AGO I TALKED OF RETIRING TO A CONVENT,14.225
58-121075-0031,THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHOM HE LOVES AND I HAD ALMOST SAID BY WHOM HE IS BELOVED IN RETURN WHEN HE LEARNED MY RESOLUTION I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE REPROACHFUL LOOK WHICH HE CAST ON ME,13.085
58-121075-0032,THEY MAY DO WHAT THEY WILL WITH ME I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU WHEN I HAD CEASED SPEAKING HE THANKFULLY RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN BUT WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD AH MAXIMILIAN I MAY HAVE MUCH TO SUFFER,13.42
58-121075-0033,BUT I FEEL AS IF MY GRANDFATHER'S LOOK AT THAT MOMENT WOULD MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR ALL,5.405
58-121075-0034,AND I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SABRING RIGHT AND LEFT AMONG THE BEDOUINS CAN HAVE DONE TO MERIT YOUR BEING REVEALED TO ME UNLESS INDEED HEAVEN TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE VICTIMS OF MY SWORD WERE INFIDELS,14.2
58-121075-0035,DID I NOT TELL YOU JUST NOW THAT I WAS RICH MAXIMILIAN TOO RICH,4.74
58-121075-0036,BUT COULD YOU NOT COMPROMISE MATTERS AND GIVE UP A PORTION OF YOUR FORTUNE TO HER SON HOW COULD I MAKE SUCH A PROPOSITION ESPECIALLY TO A WOMAN WHO ALWAYS PROFESSES TO BE SO ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED VALENTINE,13.585

58-121075-0049,AH VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF HE TREATED ME DIPLOMATICALLY THAT IS TO SAY LIKE A MAN WHO WISHES BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER TO OBTAIN A FOOTING IN THE HOUSE SO THAT HE MAY ULTIMATELY GAIN THE POWER OF DICTATING TO ITS OCCUPANTS,16.585
58-121075-0050,IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DESPISE ME SO WITHOUT ANY REASON AH FORGIVE ME SAID VALENTINE PERCEIVING THE EFFECT WHICH HER WORDS WERE PRODUCING ON MAXIMILIAN,10.855

58-121075-0061,HAS PURPOSELY ARRANGED FOR ME TO MEET M AND MADAME DE VILLEFORT AND SOMETIMES I CONFESS I HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO TRY TO READ IN HIS EYES WHETHER HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE SECRET OF OUR LOVE MY GOOD FRIEND SAID VALENTINE,15.1
58-121075-0062,I SHOULD TAKE YOU FOR A VISIONARY AND SHOULD TREMBLE FOR YOUR REASON,3.795

58-121075-0075,I NEVER PLAY FOR I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO AFFORD TO LOSE OR SUFFICIENTLY POOR TO DESIRE TO GAIN BUT I WAS AT MY OWN HOUSE YOU UNDERSTAND SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO SEND FOR THE CARDS WHICH I DID JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO TABLE,15.195
58-121075-0076,MEDEAH WAS STANDING AT THE RACK EATING HIS HAY I IMMEDIATELY PUT ON THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE TO WHICH OPERATION HE LENT HIMSELF WITH THE BEST GRACE POSSIBLE,9.94
58-121075-0077,AS I RODE BY THE COUNT'S HOUSE I PERCEIVED A LIGHT IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND FANCIED I SAW THE SHADOW OF HIS FIGURE MOVING BEHIND THE CURTAIN NOW VALENTINE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HE KNEW OF MY WISH TO POSSESS THIS HORSE,13.49
58-121075-0078,AND THAT HE LOST EXPRESSLY TO GIVE ME THE MEANS OF PROCURING HIM MY DEAR MAXIMILIAN YOU ARE REALLY TOO FANCIFUL YOU WILL NOT LOVE EVEN ME LONG A MAN WHO ACCUSTOMS HIMSELF TO LIVE IN SUCH A WORLD OF POETRY AND IMAGINATION,15.315

58-121081-0002,ON THE COUNT'S INVITATION OFFERED HIS ARM,3.105
58-121081-0003,WHEN HE FELT THE ARM OF THE BARONESS PRESS UPON HIS OWN NONE OF THIS HAD ESCAPED THE COUNT AND EVEN BY THIS MERE CONTACT OF INDIVIDUALS THE SCENE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST FOR AN OBSERVER,13.715
58-121081-0004,THE REPAST WAS MAGNIFICENT MONTE CRISTO HAD ENDEAVORED COMPLETELY TO OVERTURN THE PARISIAN IDEAS,6.985
58-121081-0005,BUT OF SUCH A KIND AS THE ARABIAN FAIRIES MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO PREPARE EVERY DELICIOUS FRUIT THAT THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE COULD PROVIDE WAS HEAPED IN VASES FROM CHINA AND JARS FROM JAPAN,12.76

58-121081-0009,MONTE CRISTO NOTICED THE GENERAL ASTONISHMENT AND BEGAN LAUGHING AND JOKING ABOUT IT GENTLEMEN HE SAID YOU WILL ADMIT THAT WHEN ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF FORTUNE THE SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE ARE ALL THAT CAN BE DESIRED,15.285

58-121081-0018,AND HERE IT IS BUT HOW COULD YOU HAVE THESE FISH BROUGHT TO FRANCE OH NOTHING MORE EASY EACH FISH WAS BROUGHT OVER IN A CASK ONE FILLED WITH RIVER HERBS AND WEEDS THE OTHER WITH RUSHES AND LAKE PLANTS,13.885

58-121081-0023,IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED A LUXURY TO HAVE THEM ALIVE IT BEING AN AMUSING SIGHT TO SEE THEM DIE FOR WHEN DYING THEY CHANGE COLOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES AND LIKE THE RAINBOW WHEN IT DISAPPEARS PASS THROUGH ALL THE PRISMATIC SHADES AFTER WHICH THEY WERE SENT TO THE KITCHEN,16.405

62-121084-0019,SHE DREAMED DON CARLOS HAD RETURNED TO SPAIN SHE BELIEVES IN DREAMS IT IS MAGNETISM SHE SAYS AND WHEN SHE DREAMS A THING IT IS SURE TO HAPPEN SHE ASSURES ME ON THIS CONVICTION I ALLOW HER TO SPECULATE,13.88
62-121084-0020,SHE SPECULATED AND LOST IT IS TRUE SHE SPECULATES WITH HER OWN MONEY NOT MINE NEVERTHELESS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS LEAVE THE WIFE'S POCKET THE HUSBAND ALWAYS FINDS IT OUT,14.695
62-121084-0021,BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF THIS,2.93
62-121084-0022,THEN YOU DO NOT SPECULATE I HOW COULD I SPECULATE WHEN I ALREADY HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE IN REGULATING MY INCOME I SHOULD BE OBLIGED BESIDES MY STEWARD TO KEEP A CLERK AND A BOY,13.33
62-121084-0023,BUT TOUCHING THESE SPANISH AFFAIRS I THINK THAT THE BARONESS DID NOT DREAM THE WHOLE OF THE DON CARLOS MATTER THE PAPERS SAID SOMETHING ABOUT IT DID THEY NOT THEN YOU BELIEVE THE PAPERS I,14.355
62-121084-0024,NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD ONLY I FANCIED THAT THE HONEST MESSAGER WAS AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE AND THAT IT ONLY ANNOUNCED TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCHES WELL,11.055
62-121084-0025,WAS BROUGHT BY TELEGRAPH SO THAT SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU HAVE LOST NEARLY ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THIS MONTH NOT NEARLY INDEED THAT IS EXACTLY MY LOSS,13.62
62-121084-0026,IT IS A HARD BLOW FOR A THIRD RATE FORTUNE,3.26
62-121084-0027,WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT CERTAINLY CONTINUED MONTE CRISTO I MAKE THREE ASSORTMENTS IN FORTUNE FIRST RATE SECOND RATE AND THIRD RATE FORTUNES,11.62
62-121084-0028,I CALL THOSE FIRST RATE WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF TREASURES ONE POSSESSES UNDER ONE'S HAND SUCH AS MINES LANDS AND FUNDED PROPERTY IN SUCH STATES AS FRANCE AUSTRIA AND ENGLAND PROVIDED THESE TREASURES AND PROPERTY,14.305
62-121084-0029,FORM A TOTAL OF ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLIONS I CALL THOSE SECOND RATE FORTUNES THAT ARE GAINED BY MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES JOINT STOCK COMPANIES VICEROYALTIES AND PRINCIPALITIES,12.89
62-121084-0030,NOT DRAWING MORE THAN ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THE WHOLE FORMING A CAPITAL OF ABOUT FIFTY MILLIONS FINALLY I CALL THOSE THIRD RATE FORTUNES WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A FLUCTUATING CAPITAL,13.83
62-121084-0031,DEPENDENT UPON THE WILL OF OTHERS OR UPON CHANCES WHICH A BANKRUPTCY INVOLVES OR A FALSE TELEGRAM SHAKES SUCH AS BANKS SPECULATIONS OF THE DAY IN FACT ALL OPERATIONS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GREATER OR LESS MISCHANCES,14.805
62-121084-0032,THE WHOLE BRINGING IN A REAL OR FICTITIOUS CAPITAL OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLIONS I THINK THIS IS ABOUT YOUR POSITION IS IT NOT CONFOUND IT YES REPLIED DANGLARS,12.21
62-121084-0033,THE RESULT THEN OF SIX MORE SUCH MONTHS AS THIS WOULD BE TO REDUCE THE THIRD RATE HOUSE TO DESPAIR OH SAID DANGLARS BECOMING VERY PALE,12.265
62-121084-0034,SEVEN SUCH MONTHS CONTINUED MONTE CRISTO IN THE SAME TONE TELL ME HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SEVEN TIMES,8.78
62-121084-0035,MAKE NEARLY TWELVE MILLIONS NO YOU HAVE NOT WELL YOU ARE RIGHT FOR IF YOU INDULGED IN SUCH REFLECTIONS YOU WOULD NEVER RISK YOUR PRINCIPAL WHICH IS TO THE SPECULATOR WHAT THE SKIN IS TO CIVILIZED MAN,15.18
62-121084-0036,WE HAVE OUR CLOTHES SOME MORE SPLENDID THAN OTHERS THIS IS OUR CREDIT BUT WHEN A MAN DIES HE HAS ONLY HIS SKIN IN THE SAME WAY ON RETIRING FROM BUSINESS,13.515
62-121084-0037,YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT YOUR REAL PRINCIPAL OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS AT THE MOST FOR THIRD RATE FORTUNES ARE NEVER MORE THAN A FOURTH OF WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE,10.985
62-121084-0038,YOU HAVE JUST LOST NEARLY TWO MILLIONS WHICH MUST OF COURSE IN THE SAME DEGREE DIMINISH YOUR CREDIT AND FICTITIOUS FORTUNE TO FOLLOW OUT MY SIMILE YOUR SKIN HAS BEEN OPENED BY BLEEDING AND THIS IF REPEATED,14.85
62-121084-0039,DO YOU WANT MONEY DO YOU WISH ME TO LEND YOU SOME,3.515
62-121084-0040,EXCLAIMED DANGLARS CALLING TO HIS ASSISTANCE ALL HIS PHILOSOPHY AND DISSIMULATION I HAVE MADE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME BY SPECULATIONS WHICH HAVE SUCCEEDED I HAVE MADE UP THE LOSS OF BLOOD BY NUTRITION I LOST A BATTLE IN SPAIN,15.79
62-121084-0041,I HAVE BEEN DEFEATED IN TRIESTE BUT MY NAVAL ARMY IN INDIA WILL HAVE TAKEN SOME GALLEONS AND MY MEXICAN PIONEERS WILL HAVE DISCOVERED SOME MINE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD,12.61
62-121084-0042,BUT THE WOUND REMAINS AND WILL REOPEN AT THE FIRST LOSS NO FOR I AM ONLY EMBARKED IN CERTAINTIES,7.63
62-121084-0043,WITH THE AIR OF A MOUNTEBANK SOUNDING HIS OWN PRAISES TO INVOLVE ME THREE GOVERNMENTS MUST CRUMBLE TO DUST WELL SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FAMINE RECOLLECT THE SEVEN FAT AND THE SEVEN LEAN KINE,17.34
62-121084-0044,AND EVEN THEN MY VESSELS WOULD BECOME CARAVANS SO MUCH THE BETTER,5.705
62-121084-0045,I SEE I WAS DECEIVED AND THAT YOU BELONG TO THE CLASS OF SECOND RATE FORTUNES I THINK I MAY ASPIRE TO THAT HONOR,8.775
62-121084-0046,WHICH REMINDED MONTE CRISTO OF THE SICKLY MOONS WHICH BAD ARTISTS ARE SO FOND OF DAUBING INTO THEIR PICTURES OF RUINS BUT WHILE WE ARE SPEAKING OF BUSINESS DANGLARS ADDED,13.47
62-121084-0047,PLEASED TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF CHANGING THE SUBJECT TELL ME,3.91
62-121084-0048,GIVE HIM MONEY IF HE IS RECOMMENDED TO YOU AND THE RECOMMENDATION SEEMS GOOD EXCELLENT HE PRESENTED HIMSELF THIS MORNING WITH A BOND OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS PAYABLE AT SIGHT ON YOU SIGNED BY BUSONI,14.25
62-121084-0049,AND RETURNED BY YOU TO ME WITH YOUR INDORSEMENT OF COURSE I IMMEDIATELY COUNTED HIM OVER THE FORTY BANK NOTES MONTE CRISTO NODDED HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF ASSENT BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED DANGLARS,13.815
62-121084-0050,HE HAS OPENED AN ACCOUNT WITH MY HOUSE FOR HIS SON MAY I ASK HOW MUCH HE ALLOWS THE YOUNG MAN FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS PER MONTH SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS PER YEAR,13.215
62-121084-0051,HOW CAN A YOUNG MAN LIVE UPON FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN SHOULD WANT A FEW THOUSANDS MORE DO NOT ADVANCE IT THE FATHER WILL NEVER REPAY IT,14.215
62-121084-0052,YOU DO NOT KNOW THESE ULTRAMONTANE MILLIONAIRES THEY ARE REGULAR MISERS AND BY WHOM WERE THEY RECOMMENDED TO YOU OH BY THE HOUSE OF FENZI ONE OF THE BEST IN FLORENCE,12.84
62-121084-0053,I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY YOU WILL LOSE BUT NEVERTHELESS MIND YOU HOLD TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WOULD YOU NOT TRUST THE CAVALCANTI I OH I WOULD ADVANCE SIX MILLIONS ON HIS SIGNATURE,14.315
62-121084-0054,I WAS ONLY SPEAKING IN REFERENCE TO THE SECOND RATE FORTUNES WE WERE MENTIONING JUST NOW AND WITH ALL THIS HOW UNASSUMING HE IS,9.895
62-121084-0055,AND YOU WOULD HAVE FLATTERED HIM FOR CERTAINLY AS YOU SAY HE HAS NO MANNER THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM HE APPEARED TO ME LIKE AN OLD LIEUTENANT WHO HAD GROWN MOULDY UNDER HIS EPAULETS,13.755
62-121084-0056,BUT ALL THE ITALIANS ARE THE SAME THEY ARE LIKE OLD JEWS WHEN THEY ARE NOT GLITTERING IN ORIENTAL SPLENDOR THE YOUNG MAN IS BETTER,9.59
62-121084-0057,HE APPEARED TOLERABLE I WAS UNEASY ABOUT HIM WHY BECAUSE YOU MET HIM AT MY HOUSE JUST AFTER HIS INTRODUCTION INTO THE WORLD AS THEY TOLD ME,13.065
62-121084-0058,HE HAS BEEN TRAVELLING WITH A VERY SEVERE TUTOR AND HAD NEVER BEEN TO PARIS BEFORE AH I BELIEVE NOBLEMEN MARRY AMONGST THEMSELVES DO THEY NOT,11.765
62-121084-0059,THEY LIKE TO UNITE THEIR FORTUNES IT IS USUAL CERTAINLY BUT CAVALCANTI IS AN ORIGINAL WHO DOES NOTHING LIKE OTHER PEOPLE,9.59
62-121084-0060,DO YOU THINK SO I AM SURE OF IT AND YOU HAVE HEARD HIS FORTUNE MENTIONED NOTHING ELSE WAS TALKED OF ONLY SOME SAID HE WAS WORTH MILLIONS AND OTHERS THAT HE DID NOT POSSESS A FARTHING,15.66
62-121084-0061,AND WHAT IS YOUR OPINION I OUGHT NOT TO INFLUENCE YOU BECAUSE IT IS ONLY MY OWN PERSONAL IMPRESSION WELL AND IT IS THAT,10.98
62-121084-0062,THAT ALL THESE OLD PODESTAS THESE ANCIENT CONDOTTIERI FOR THE CAVALCANTI HAVE COMMANDED ARMIES AND GOVERNED PROVINCES MY OPINION I SAY IS THAT THEY HAVE BURIED THEIR MILLIONS IN CORNERS,13.5
62-121084-0063,THE SECRET OF WHICH THEY HAVE TRANSMITTED ONLY TO THEIR ELDEST SONS WHO HAVE DONE THE SAME FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION AND THE PROOF OF THIS IS SEEN IN THEIR YELLOW AND DRY APPEARANCE LIKE THE FLORINS OF THE REPUBLIC WHICH FROM BEING CONSTANTLY GAZED UPON,16.02
62-121084-0064,HAVE BECOME REFLECTED IN THEM CERTAINLY SAID DANGLARS AND THIS IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE FACT OF THEIR NOT POSSESSING AN INCH OF LAND VERY LITTLE AT LEAST I KNOW OF NONE WHICH CAVALCANTI POSSESSES,15.58
62-121084-0065,EXCEPTING HIS PALACE IN LUCCA AH HE HAS A PALACE,5.435
62-121084-0066,COME THAT IS SOMETHING YES AND MORE THAN THAT HE LETS IT TO THE MINISTER OF FINANCE WHILE HE LIVES IN A SIMPLE HOUSE OH AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE I THINK THE OLD FELLOW IS VERY CLOSE,15.62
62-121084-0067,COME YOU DO NOT FLATTER HIM I SCARCELY KNOW HIM I THINK I HAVE SEEN HIM THREE TIMES IN MY LIFE ALL I KNOW RELATING TO HIM IS THROUGH BUSONI AND HIMSELF,11.81
62-121084-0068,HE WAS TELLING ME THIS MORNING THAT TIRED OF LETTING HIS PROPERTY LIE DORMANT IN ITALY WHICH IS A DEAD NATION HE WISHED TO FIND A METHOD EITHER IN FRANCE OR ENGLAND OF MULTIPLYING HIS MILLIONS,12.91
62-121084-0069,BUT REMEMBER THAT THOUGH I PLACE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN BUSONI I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NEVER MIND ACCEPT MY THANKS FOR THE CLIENT YOU HAVE SENT ME IT IS A FINE NAME TO INSCRIBE ON MY LEDGERS,15.28
62-121084-0070,AND MY CASHIER WAS QUITE PROUD OF IT WHEN I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHO THE CAVALCANTI WERE BY THE WAY THIS IS MERELY A SIMPLE QUESTION WHEN THIS SORT OF PEOPLE MARRY THEIR SONS DO THEY GIVE THEM ANY FORTUNE,14.09
62-121084-0071,THAT DEPENDS UPON CIRCUMSTANCES,2.33
62-121084-0072,ONE OF THE NOBLEST FAMILIES IN TUSCANY WHO WHEN HIS SONS MARRIED ACCORDING TO HIS WISH GAVE THEM MILLIONS AND WHEN THEY MARRIED AGAINST HIS CONSENT MERELY ALLOWED THEM THIRTY CROWNS A MONTH SHOULD ANDREA,16.18
62-121084-0073,HE WILL PERHAPS GIVE HIM ONE TWO OR THREE MILLIONS FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSING IT WERE THE DAUGHTER OF A BANKER HE MIGHT TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER IN LAW OF HIS SON THEN AGAIN IF HE DISLIKED HIS CHOICE,15.625
62-121084-0074,DOUBLE LOCKS HIS COFFER AND MASTER ANDREA WOULD BE OBLIGED TO LIVE LIKE THE SONS OF A PARISIAN FAMILY BY SHUFFLING CARDS OR RATTLING THE DICE AH THAT BOY WILL FIND OUT SOME BAVARIAN OR PERUVIAN PRINCESS,15.235
62-121084-0075,HE WILL WANT A CROWN AND AN IMMENSE FORTUNE NO THESE GRAND LORDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ALPS FREQUENTLY MARRY INTO PLAIN FAMILIES LIKE JUPITER THEY LIKE TO CROSS THE RACE,13.415
62-121084-0076,AND YOU KNOW I AM A SPECULATOR,2.4
62-121084-0077,AH WELL HE WOULD CARE VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT I THINK BUT HE IS BETROTHED TO YOUR DAUGHTER I BELIEVE WELL,9.09
62-121084-0078,BUT MADAME DE MORCERF AND ALBERT YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT IT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD MATCH,6.215

62-121084-0083,CERTAINLY YOUR NAME IS POPULAR AND DOES HONOR TO THE TITLE THEY HAVE ADORNED IT WITH BUT YOU ARE TOO INTELLIGENT NOT TO KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO A PREJUDICE TOO FIRMLY ROOTED TO BE EXTERMINATED,13.0
62-121084-0084,A NOBILITY WHICH DATES BACK FIVE CENTURIES IS WORTH MORE THAN ONE THAT CAN ONLY RECKON TWENTY YEARS AND FOR THIS VERY REASON SAID DANGLARS WITH A SMILE,12.445
62-121084-0085,STILL I SHOULD NOT THINK THE MORCERFS WOULD YIELD TO THE CAVALCANTI THE MORCERFS,6.34
62-121084-0086,YOU ARE A MAN OF THE WORLD ARE YOU NOT I THINK SO AND YOU UNDERSTAND HERALDRY A LITTLE WELL LOOK AT MY COAT OF ARMS IT IS WORTH MORE THAN MORCERF'S,14.8199375

65-121089-0001,THE COUNT LOOKED AT MERCEDES AS IF TO INTERROGATE HER BUT SHE CONTINUED TO WALK ON IN SILENCE AND HE REFRAINED FROM SPEAKING,7.8
65-121089-0002,THEY REACHED THE BUILDING ORNAMENTED WITH MAGNIFICENT FRUITS WHICH RIPEN AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY IN THE ARTIFICIAL TEMPERATURE WHICH TAKES THE PLACE OF THE SUN SO FREQUENTLY ABSENT IN OUR CLIMATE THE COUNTESS LEFT THE ARM OF MONTE CRISTO,13.7
65-121089-0003,AND GATHERED A BUNCH OF MUSCATEL GRAPES SEE COUNT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE SO SAD IN ITS EXPRESSION THAT ONE COULD ALMOST DETECT THE TEARS ON HER EYELIDS SEE OUR FRENCH GRAPES ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED I KNOW WITH YOURS OF SICILY AND CYPRUS,15.36

65-121089-0006,SHE EXCLAIMED IN SO PLAINTIVE AN ACCENT THAT IT SEEMED TO STIFLE A SOB REALLY YOU PAIN ME A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED THE PEACH LIKE THE GRAPES FELL TO THE GROUND COUNT ADDED MERCEDES WITH A SUPPLICATING GLANCE,16.34
65-121089-0007,THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL ARABIAN CUSTOM WHICH MAKES ETERNAL FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE TOGETHER EATEN BREAD AND SALT UNDER THE SAME ROOF I KNOW IT MADAME REPLIED THE COUNT BUT WE ARE IN FRANCE AND NOT IN ARABIA,13.58
65-121089-0008,AND IN FRANCE ETERNAL FRIENDSHIPS ARE AS RARE AS THE CUSTOM OF DIVIDING BREAD AND SALT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT SAID THE COUNTESS BREATHLESSLY WITH HER EYES FIXED ON MONTE CRISTO WHOSE ARM SHE CONVULSIVELY PRESSED WITH BOTH HANDS WE ARE FRIENDS ARE WE NOT,16.245
65-121089-0009,THE COUNT BECAME PALE AS DEATH THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS HEART AND THEN AGAIN RISING DYED HIS CHEEKS WITH CRIMSON HIS EYES SWAM LIKE THOSE OF A MAN SUDDENLY DAZZLED CERTAINLY WE ARE FRIENDS HE REPLIED WHY SHOULD WE NOT BE,15.54
65-121089-0010,THE ANSWER WAS SO LITTLE LIKE THE ONE MERCEDES DESIRED THAT SHE TURNED AWAY TO GIVE VENT TO A SIGH WHICH SOUNDED MORE LIKE A GROAN THANK YOU SHE SAID AND THEY WALKED ON AGAIN,12.5

65-121089-0017,WHEN WAR CAME AND CARRIED ME AWAY I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME WELL ENOUGH TO WAIT FOR ME AND EVEN TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO MY MEMORY WHEN I RETURNED SHE WAS MARRIED THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MOST MEN WHO HAVE PASSED TWENTY YEARS OF AGE,14.335
65-121089-0018,PERHAPS MY HEART WAS WEAKER THAN THE HEARTS OF MOST MEN AND I SUFFERED MORE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IN MY PLACE THAT IS ALL THE COUNTESS STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AS IF GASPING FOR BREATH YES SHE SAID,12.81

65-121089-0023,MONTE CRISTO REMAINED AS UNMOVED AS IF THE REPROACH HAD NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TO HIM ALBERT AT THIS MOMENT RAN IN OH MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED SUCH A MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED THE COUNTESS,14.94
65-121089-0024,AS THOUGH AWAKENING FROM A SLEEP TO THE REALITIES OF LIFE DID YOU SAY A MISFORTUNE INDEED I SHOULD EXPECT MISFORTUNES,7.555
65-121089-0025,WELL HE COMES TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER WHY SO,5.045
65-121089-0026,MADAME DE VILLEFORT WHO WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS WOULD NEITHER BELIEVE NOR THINK OF THE MISFORTUNE BUT MADEMOISELLE VALENTINE AT THE FIRST WORDS GUESSED THE WHOLE TRUTH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE PRECAUTIONS OF HER FATHER THE BLOW STRUCK HER LIKE A THUNDERBOLT,14.67

65-122444-0000,INSTEAD OF RETURNING DIRECTLY HOME,2.555
65-122444-0001,THIS TIME HE HAD DECIDED TO RELATE ALL THAT HAD PASSED,3.44
65-122444-0002,WHEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD FINISHED HE SAID HUM ALL THIS SAVORS OF HIS EMINENCE A LEAGUE OFF BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE SAID D'ARTAGNAN NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT PRESENT BUT QUITTING PARIS AS I TOLD YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,15.56
65-122444-0003,I WILL SEE THE QUEEN I WILL RELATE TO HER THE DETAILS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS POOR WOMAN OF WHICH SHE IS NO DOUBT IGNORANT THESE DETAILS WILL GUIDE HER ON HER PART AND ON YOUR RETURN I SHALL PERHAPS HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU RELY ON ME,14.78
65-122444-0004,IN FACT IN ADDITION TO THAT YELLOW SICKLY PALENESS WHICH INDICATES THE INSINUATION OF THE BILE IN THE BLOOD AND WHICH MIGHT BESIDES BE ACCIDENTAL,9.985
65-122444-0005,D'ARTAGNAN REMARKED SOMETHING PERFIDIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PLAY OF THE WRINKLED FEATURES OF HIS COUNTENANCE A ROGUE DOES NOT LAUGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT AN HONEST MAN DOES A HYPOCRITE DOES NOT SHED THE TEARS OF A MAN OF GOOD FAITH,14.135
65-122444-0006,ALL FALSEHOOD IS A MASK AND HOWEVER WELL MADE THE MASK MAY BE WITH A LITTLE ATTENTION WE MAY ALWAYS SUCCEED IN DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE TRUE FACE,9.45
65-122444-0007,WELL YOUNG MAN SAID HE WE APPEAR TO PASS RATHER GAY NIGHTS SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING PESTE YOU SEEM TO REVERSE ORDINARY CUSTOMS AND COME HOME AT THE HOUR WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT,14.51
65-122444-0008,NO ONE CAN REPROACH YOU FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND MONSIEUR BONACIEUX SAID THE YOUNG MAN YOU ARE A MODEL FOR REGULAR PEOPLE IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN A MAN POSSESSES A YOUNG AND PRETTY WIFE HE HAS NO NEED TO SEEK HAPPINESS ELSEWHERE,14.08
65-122444-0009,HAPPINESS COMES TO MEET HIM DOES IT NOT MONSIEUR BONACIEUX BONACIEUX BECAME AS PALE AS DEATH AND GRINNED A GHASTLY SMILE AH AH SAID BONACIEUX YOU ARE A JOCULAR COMPANION,13.61
65-122444-0010,D'ARTAGNAN GLANCED DOWN AT HIS BOOTS ALL COVERED WITH MUD BUT THAT SAME GLANCE FELL UPON THE SHOES AND STOCKINGS OF THE MERCER AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID THEY HAD BEEN DIPPED IN THE SAME MUD HEAP BOTH WERE STAINED WITH SPLASHES OF MUD OF THE SAME APPEARANCE,16.4399375
65-122444-0011,THEN A SUDDEN IDEA CROSSED THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN THAT LITTLE STOUT MAN SHORT AND ELDERLY THAT SORT OF LACKEY DRESSED IN DARK CLOTHES TREATED WITHOUT CEREMONY BY THE MEN WEARING SWORDS WHO COMPOSED THE ESCORT,14.655
65-122444-0012,WAS BONACIEUX HIMSELF THE HUSBAND HAD PRESIDED AT THE ABDUCTION OF HIS WIFE A TERRIBLE INCLINATION SEIZED D'ARTAGNAN TO GRASP THE MERCER BY THE THROAT AND STRANGLE HIM BUT AS WE HAVE SAID,13.79
65-122444-0013,THAT BONACIEUX WAS TERRIFIED AT IT AND HE ENDEAVORED TO DRAW BACK A STEP OR TWO BUT AS HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE HALF OF THE DOOR WHICH WAS SHUT THE OBSTACLE COMPELLED HIM TO KEEP HIS PLACE,11.155
65-122444-0014,AH BUT YOU ARE JOKING MY WORTHY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IF MY BOOTS NEED A SPONGE YOUR STOCKINGS AND SHOES STAND IN EQUAL NEED OF A BRUSH MAY YOU NOT HAVE BEEN PHILANDERING A LITTLE ALSO MONSIEUR BONACIEUX,14.095
65-122444-0015,THAT'S UNPARDONABLE IN A MAN OF YOUR AGE AND WHO BESIDES HAS SUCH A PRETTY WIFE AS YOURS OH LORD NO,8.27
65-122444-0016,THE PLACE NAMED BY BONACIEUX AS THAT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY WAS A FRESH PROOF IN SUPPORT OF THE SUSPICIONS D'ARTAGNAN HAD CONCEIVED,8.48

66-354-0019,I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS I COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND I PASSED THROUGH SCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME,15.08
66-354-0020,I REMAINED TWO DAYS AT LAUSANNE,2.445
66-354-0021,I CONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED BY DEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TOWARDS GENEVA,15.29
66-354-0022,THE ROAD RAN BY THE SIDE OF THE LAKE WHICH BECAME NARROWER AS I APPROACHED MY NATIVE TOWN I DISCOVERED MORE DISTINCTLY THE BLACK SIDES OF JURA AND THE,9.075
66-354-0023,I WEPT LIKE A CHILD DEAR MOUNTAINS MY OWN BEAUTIFUL LAKE HOW DO YOU WELCOME YOUR WANDERER YOUR SUMMITS ARE CLEAR THE SKY AND LAKE ARE BLUE AND PLACID IS THIS TO PROGNOSTICATE PEACE OR TO MOCK AT MY UNHAPPINESS,15.0
66-354-0024,I FEAR MY FRIEND THAT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF TEDIOUS BY DWELLING ON THESE PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY WERE DAYS OF COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS AND I THINK OF THEM WITH PLEASURE MY COUNTRY MY BELOVED COUNTRY,12.27
66-354-0025,WHO BUT A NATIVE CAN TELL THE DELIGHT I TOOK IN AGAIN BEHOLDING THY STREAMS THY MOUNTAINS AND MORE THAN ALL THY LOVELY LAKE YET AS I DREW NEARER HOME GRIEF AND FEAR AGAIN OVERCAME ME,14.095
66-354-0026,NIGHT ALSO CLOSED AROUND AND WHEN I COULD HARDLY SEE THE DARK MOUNTAINS I FELT STILL MORE GLOOMILY THE PICTURE APPEARED A VAST AND DIM SCENE OF EVIL AND I FORESAW OBSCURELY THAT I WAS DESTINED TO BECOME THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMAN BEINGS,14.635
66-354-0027,ALAS I PROPHESIED TRULY AND FAILED ONLY IN ONE SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN ALL THE MISERY I IMAGINED AND DREADED I DID NOT CONCEIVE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ANGUISH I WAS DESTINED TO ENDURE,12.265
66-354-0028,A VILLAGE AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A LEAGUE FROM THE CITY THE SKY WAS SERENE AND AS I WAS UNABLE TO REST I RESOLVED TO VISIT THE SPOT WHERE MY POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN MURDERED AS I COULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE TOWN I WAS OBLIGED TO CROSS THE LAKE IN A BOAT TO ARRIVE AT PLAINPALAIS,16.725
66-354-0029,THE STORM APPEARED TO APPROACH RAPIDLY AND ON LANDING I ASCENDED A LOW HILL THAT I MIGHT OBSERVE ITS PROGRESS IT ADVANCED THE HEAVENS WERE CLOUDED AND I SOON FELT THE RAIN COMING SLOWLY IN LARGE DROPS BUT ITS VIOLENCE QUICKLY INCREASED,15.24
66-354-0030,I QUITTED MY SEAT AND WALKED ON ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS AND STORM INCREASED EVERY MINUTE AND THE THUNDER BURST WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH OVER MY HEAD IT WAS ECHOED FROM SALEVE THE JURAS AND THE ALPS OF SAVOY,12.69
66-354-0031,UNTIL THE EYE RECOVERED ITSELF FROM THE PRECEDING FLASH THE STORM AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN SWITZERLAND APPEARED AT ONCE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEAVENS THE MOST VIOLENT STORM HUNG EXACTLY NORTH OF THE TOWN OVER THE PART OF THE LAKE WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE PROMONTORY OF BELRIVE,15.785
66-354-0032,I WANDERED ON WITH A HASTY STEP THIS NOBLE WAR IN THE SKY ELEVATED MY SPIRITS I CLASPED MY HANDS AND EXCLAIMED ALOUD WILLIAM DEAR ANGEL,10.11
66-354-0033,ITS GIGANTIC STATURE AND THE DEFORMITY OF ITS ASPECT MORE HIDEOUS THAN BELONGS TO HUMANITY INSTANTLY INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS THE WRETCH THE FILTHY DAEMON TO WHOM I HAD GIVEN LIFE WHAT DID HE THERE,12.11
66-354-0034,THE MURDERER OF MY BROTHER NO SOONER DID THAT IDEA CROSS MY IMAGINATION THAN I BECAME CONVINCED OF ITS TRUTH MY TEETH CHATTERED AND I WAS FORCED TO LEAN AGAINST A TREE FOR SUPPORT THE FIGURE PASSED ME QUICKLY AND I LOST IT IN THE GLOOM,15.67
66-354-0035,NOTHING IN HUMAN SHAPE COULD HAVE DESTROYED THE FAIR CHILD HE WAS THE MURDERER I COULD NOT DOUBT IT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF THE FACT I THOUGHT OF PURSUING THE DEVIL,12.855
66-354-0036,BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN FOR ANOTHER FLASH DISCOVERED HIM TO ME HANGING AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE NEARLY PERPENDICULAR ASCENT,6.27
66-354-0037,A HILL THAT BOUNDS PLAINPALAIS ON THE SOUTH HE SOON REACHED THE SUMMIT AND DISAPPEARED I REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE THUNDER CEASED,11.515
66-354-0038,BUT THE RAIN STILL CONTINUED AND THE SCENE WAS ENVELOPED IN AN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS I REVOLVED IN MY MIND THE EVENTS WHICH I HAD UNTIL NOW SOUGHT TO FORGET THE WHOLE TRAIN OF MY PROGRESS TOWARD THE CREATION THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORKS OF MY OWN HANDS AT MY BEDSIDE,15.935
66-354-0039,ITS DEPARTURE TWO YEARS HAD NOW NEARLY ELAPSED SINCE THE NIGHT ON WHICH HE FIRST RECEIVED LIFE AND WAS THIS HIS FIRST CRIME ALAS I HAD TURNED LOOSE INTO THE WORLD A DEPRAVED WRETCH WHOSE DELIGHT WAS IN CARNAGE AND MISERY,15.935
66-354-0040,HAD HE NOT MURDERED MY BROTHER NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE THE ANGUISH I SUFFERED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT WHICH I SPENT COLD AND WET IN THE OPEN AIR BUT I DID NOT FEEL THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE WEATHER,14.79
66-354-0041,MY OWN SPIRIT LET LOOSE FROM THE GRAVE AND FORCED TO DESTROY ALL THAT WAS DEAR TO ME DAY DAWNED AND I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE TOWN THE GATES WERE OPEN AND I HASTENED TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE,14.47
66-354-0042,MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO DISCOVER WHAT I KNEW OF THE MURDERER AND CAUSE INSTANT PURSUIT TO BE MADE BUT I PAUSED WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE STORY THAT I HAD TO TELL A BEING WHOM I MYSELF HAD FORMED AND ENDUED WITH LIFE,13.535
66-354-0043,HAD MET ME AT MIDNIGHT AMONG THE PRECIPICES OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN,4.105
66-354-0044,AND WHICH WOULD GIVE AN AIR OF DELIRIUM TO A TALE OTHERWISE SO UTTERLY IMPROBABLE I WELL KNEW THAT IF ANY OTHER HAD COMMUNICATED SUCH A RELATION TO ME,8.845
66-354-0045,BESIDES THE STRANGE NATURE OF THE ANIMAL WOULD ELUDE ALL PURSUIT EVEN IF I WERE SO FAR CREDITED AS TO PERSUADE MY RELATIVES TO COMMENCE IT AND THEN OF WHAT USE WOULD BE PURSUIT WHO COULD ARREST A CREATURE CAPABLE OF SCALING THE OVERHANGING SIDES OF MONT SALEVE,15.69
66-354-0046,SIX YEARS HAD ELAPSED PASSED IN A DREAM BUT FOR ONE INDELIBLE TRACE AND I STOOD IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I HAD LAST EMBRACED MY FATHER BEFORE MY DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT BELOVED AND VENERABLE PARENT,12.78
66-354-0047,WHICH STOOD OVER THE MANTEL PIECE IT WAS AN HISTORICAL SUBJECT,4.51
66-354-0048,AND REPRESENTED CAROLINE BEAUFORT IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR KNEELING BY THE COFFIN OF HER DEAD FATHER HER GARB WAS RUSTIC AND HER CHEEK PALE BUT THERE WAS AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND BEAUTY THAT HARDLY PERMITTED THE SENTIMENT OF PITY,14.23
66-354-0049,BELOW THIS PICTURE WAS A MINIATURE OF WILLIAM AND MY TEARS FLOWED WHEN I LOOKED UPON IT WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED ERNEST ENTERED,8.47
66-354-0050,A SENSE OF MORTAL AGONY CREPT OVER MY FRAME BEFORE I HAD ONLY IMAGINED THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MY DESOLATED HOME THE REALITY CAME ON ME AS A NEW AND A NOT LESS TERRIBLE DISASTER I TRIED TO CALM ERNEST,14.23
66-354-0051,I ENQUIRED MORE MINUTELY CONCERNING MY FATHER,3.135
66-354-0052,SHE MOST OF ALL SAID ERNEST REQUIRES CONSOLATION SHE ACCUSED HERSELF OF HAVING CAUSED THE DEATH OF MY BROTHER AND THAT MADE HER VERY WRETCHED BUT SINCE THE MURDERER HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THE MURDERER DISCOVERED GOOD GOD HOW CAN THAT BE,14.275
66-354-0053,WHO COULD ATTEMPT TO PURSUE HIM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE ONE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO OVERTAKE THE WINDS OR CONFINE A MOUNTAIN STREAM WITH A STRAW,7.17
66-354-0054,I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN REPLIED MY BROTHER IN ACCENTS OF WONDER BUT TO US THE DISCOVERY WE HAVE MADE COMPLETES OUR MISERY NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT AT FIRST AND EVEN NOW ELIZABETH WILL NOT BE CONVINCED,13.175
66-354-0055,NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE INDEED WHO WOULD CREDIT THAT JUSTINE MORITZ WHO WAS SO AMIABLE AND FOND OF ALL THE FAMILY COULD SUDDENLY BECOME SO CAPABLE OF SO FRIGHTFUL SO APPALLING A CRIME JUSTINE MORITZ,14.84
66-354-0056,THE MORNING ON WHICH THE MURDER OF POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN DISCOVERED JUSTINE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND CONFINED TO HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS DURING THIS INTERVAL ONE OF THE SERVANTS HAPPENING TO EXAMINE THE APPAREL SHE HAD WORN ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER,13.485
66-354-0057,HAD DISCOVERED IN HER POCKET THE PICTURE OF MY MOTHER WHICH HAD BEEN JUDGED TO BE THE TEMPTATION OF THE MURDERER THE SERVANT INSTANTLY SHOWED IT TO ONE OF THE OTHERS WHO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANY OF THE FAMILY WENT TO A MAGISTRATE AND UPON THEIR DEPOSITION JUSTINE WAS APPREHENDED,15.295
66-354-0058,I KNOW THE MURDERER JUSTINE POOR GOOD JUSTINE IS INNOCENT AT THAT INSTANT MY FATHER ENTERED I SAW UNHAPPINESS DEEPLY IMPRESSED ON HIS COUNTENANCE BUT HE ENDEAVOURED TO WELCOME ME CHEERFULLY,14.915
66-354-0059,AND AFTER WE HAD EXCHANGED OUR MOURNFUL GREETING WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED SOME OTHER TOPIC THAN THAT OF OUR DISASTER HAD NOT ERNEST EXCLAIMED GOOD GOD PAPA,9.81
66-354-0060,WE DO ALSO UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED MY FATHER FOR INDEED I HAD RATHER HAVE BEEN FOR EVER IGNORANT THAN HAVE DISCOVERED SO MUCH DEPRAVITY AND UNGRATITUDE IN ONE I VALUED SO HIGHLY MY DEAR FATHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN JUSTINE IS INNOCENT,15.04
66-354-0061,AND INDEED EVERY HUMAN BEING WAS GUILTLESS OF THIS MURDER I HAD NO FEAR THEREFORE THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE COULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD STRONG ENOUGH TO CONVICT HER MY TALE WAS NOT ONE TO ANNOUNCE PUBLICLY ITS ASTOUNDING HORROR WOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS MADNESS BY THE VULGAR,14.92
66-354-0062,THERE WAS THE SAME CANDOUR THE SAME VIVACITY BUT IT WAS ALLIED TO AN EXPRESSION MORE FULL OF SENSIBILITY AND INTELLECT SHE WELCOMED ME WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION YOUR ARRIVAL MY DEAR COUSIN SAID SHE FILLS ME WITH HOPE,14.17
66-354-0063,YOU PERHAPS WILL FIND SOME MEANS TO JUSTIFY MY POOR GUILTLESS JUSTINE ALAS WHO IS SAFE IF SHE BE CONVICTED OF CRIME I RELY ON HER INNOCENCE AS CERTAINLY AS I DO UPON MY OWN OUR MISFORTUNE IS DOUBLY HARD TO US,15.55
66-354-0064,WE HAVE NOT ONLY LOST THAT LOVELY DARLING BOY BUT THIS POOR GIRL WHOM I SINCERELY LOVE IS TO BE TORN AWAY BY EVEN A WORSE FATE IF SHE IS CONDEMNED I NEVER SHALL KNOW JOY MORE BUT SHE WILL NOT I AM SURE SHE WILL NOT,15.75
66-354-0065,AND THEN I SHALL BE HAPPY AGAIN EVEN AFTER THE SAD DEATH OF MY LITTLE WILLIAM SHE IS INNOCENT MY ELIZABETH SAID I AND THAT SHALL BE PROVED FEAR NOTHING BUT LET YOUR SPIRITS BE CHEERED BY THE ASSURANCE OF HER ACQUITTAL,15.28
66-354-0066,HOW KIND AND GENEROUS YOU ARE EVERY ONE ELSE BELIEVES IN HER GUILT,4.5
66-355-0000,CHAPTER EIGHT WE PASSED A FEW SAD HOURS UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO COMMENCE MY FATHER AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEING OBLIGED TO ATTEND AS WITNESSES I ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE COURT,15.46
66-355-0001,THE OTHER FAR MORE DREADFULLY MURDERED WITH EVERY AGGRAVATION OF INFAMY THAT COULD MAKE THE MURDER MEMORABLE IN HORROR JUSTINE ALSO WAS A GIRL OF MERIT AND POSSESSED QUALITIES WHICH PROMISED TO RENDER HER LIFE HAPPY NOW,15.2
66-355-0002,IN AN IGNOMINIOUS GRAVE AND I THE CAUSE A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER WOULD I HAVE CONFESSED MYSELF GUILTY OF THE CRIME ASCRIBED TO JUSTINE BUT I WAS ABSENT WHEN IT WAS COMMITTED AND SUCH A DECLARATION WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN,15.795
66-355-0003,THE APPEARANCE OF JUSTINE WAS CALM SHE WAS DRESSED IN MOURNING AND HER COUNTENANCE ALWAYS ENGAGING WAS RENDERED BY THE SOLEMNITY OF HER FEELINGS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL,11.37
66-355-0004,YET SHE APPEARED CONFIDENT IN INNOCENCE AND DID NOT TREMBLE ALTHOUGH GAZED ON AND EXECRATED BY THOUSANDS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER BEAUTY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE EXCITED WAS OBLITERATED IN THE MINDS OF THE SPECTATORS,12.485
66-355-0005,SHE WORKED UP HER MIND TO AN APPEARANCE OF COURAGE WHEN SHE ENTERED THE COURT SHE THREW HER EYES ROUND IT AND QUICKLY DISCOVERED WHERE WE WERE SEATED A TEAR SEEMED TO DIM HER EYE WHEN SHE SAW US BUT SHE QUICKLY RECOVERED HERSELF,14.76
66-355-0006,AND A LOOK OF SORROWFUL AFFECTION SEEMED TO ATTEST HER UTTER GUILTLESSNESS THE TRIAL BEGAN AND AFTER THE ADVOCATE AGAINST HER HAD STATED THE CHARGE SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED SEVERAL STRANGE FACTS COMBINED AGAINST HER,14.955
66-355-0007,WHICH MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED ANYONE WHO HAD NOT SUCH PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE AS I HAD SHE HAD BEEN OUT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND TOWARDS MORNING HAD BEEN PERCEIVED BY A MARKET WOMAN,11.88
66-355-0008,NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF THE MURDERED CHILD HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS FOUND THE WOMAN ASKED HER WHAT SHE DID THERE BUT SHE LOOKED VERY STRANGELY AND ONLY RETURNED A CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK,15.27
66-355-0009,AND WHEN ONE INQUIRED WHERE SHE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT SHE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THE CHILD AND DEMANDED EARNESTLY IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD CONCERNING HIM WHEN SHOWN THE BODY SHE FELL INTO VIOLENT HYSTERICS AND KEPT HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS,15.245
66-355-0010,THE PICTURE WAS THEN PRODUCED WHICH THE SERVANT HAD FOUND IN HER POCKET AND WHEN ELIZABETH IN A FALTERING VOICE PROVED THAT IT WAS THE SAME WHICH AN HOUR BEFORE THE CHILD HAD BEEN MISSED SHE HAD PLACED ROUND HIS NECK,14.15
66-355-0011,A MURMUR OF HORROR AND INDIGNATION FILLED THE COURT JUSTINE WAS CALLED ON FOR HER DEFENCE AS THE TRIAL HAD PROCEEDED HER COUNTENANCE HAD ALTERED SURPRISE,13.8
66-355-0012,HORROR AND MISERY WERE STRONGLY EXPRESSED SOMETIMES SHE STRUGGLED WITH HER TEARS BUT WHEN SHE WAS DESIRED TO PLEAD SHE COLLECTED HER POWERS AND SPOKE IN AN AUDIBLE,11.325
66-355-0013,GOD KNOWS SHE SAID HOW ENTIRELY I AM INNOCENT BUT I DO NOT PRETEND THAT MY PROTESTATIONS SHOULD ACQUIT ME,8.835
66-355-0014,I REST MY INNOCENCE ON A PLAIN AND SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCED AGAINST ME AND I HOPE THE CHARACTER I HAVE ALWAYS BORNE WILL INCLINE MY JUDGES TO A FAVOURABLE INTERPRETATION WHERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE APPEARS DOUBTFUL OR SUSPICIOUS,15.185
66-355-0015,SHE THEN RELATED THAT BY THE PERMISSION OF ELIZABETH SHE HAD PASSED THE EVENING OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AT THE HOUSE OF AN AUNT AT CHENE,9.275
66-355-0016,BELONGING TO A COTTAGE BEING UNWILLING TO CALL UP THE INHABITANTS TO WHOM SHE WAS WELL KNOWN MOST OF THE NIGHT SHE SPENT HERE WATCHING TOWARDS MORNING SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE SLEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES SOME STEPS DISTURBED HER AND SHE AWOKE,14.385
66-355-0017,IT WAS DAWN AND SHE QUITTED HER ASYLUM THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FIND MY BROTHER IF SHE HAD GONE NEAR THE SPOT WHERE HIS BODY LAY IT WAS WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEWILDERED WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE MARKET WOMAN WAS NOT SURPRISING,15.645
66-355-0018,HOW HEAVILY AND FATALLY THIS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WEIGHS AGAINST ME BUT I HAVE NO POWER OF EXPLAINING IT AND WHEN I HAVE EXPRESSED MY UTTER IGNORANCE I AM ONLY LEFT TO CONJECTURE CONCERNING THE PROBABILITIES BY WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN MY POCKET,15.215
66-355-0019,BUT HERE ALSO I AM CHECKED I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NO ENEMY ON EARTH AND NONE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO DESTROY ME WANTONLY DID THE MURDERER PLACE IT THERE I KNOW OF NO OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED HIM FOR SO DOING,15.015
66-355-0020,OR IF I HAD WHY SHOULD HE HAVE STOLEN THE JEWEL TO PART WITH IT AGAIN SO SOON I COMMIT MY CAUSE TO THE JUSTICE OF MY JUDGES YET I SEE NO ROOM FOR HOPE,13.055
66-355-0021,I BEG PERMISSION TO HAVE A FEW WITNESSES EXAMINED CONCERNING MY CHARACTER AND IF THEIR TESTIMONY SHALL NOT OVERWEIGH MY SUPPOSED GUILT I MUST BE CONDEMNED ALTHOUGH I WOULD PLEDGE MY SALVATION ON MY INNOCENCE,13.97
66-355-0022,SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED WHO HAD KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY SPOKE WELL OF HER BUT FEAR AND HATRED OF THE CRIME OF WHICH THEY SUPPOSED HER GUILTY RENDERED THEM TIMOROUS AND UNWILLING TO COME FORWARD,11.91
66-355-0023,ELIZABETH SAW EVEN THIS LAST RESOURCE HER EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS AND IRREPROACHABLE CONDUCT ABOUT TO FAIL THE ACCUSED WHEN ALTHOUGH VIOLENTLY AGITATED SHE DESIRED PERMISSION TO ADDRESS THE COURT,12.94
66-355-0024,I AM SAID SHE THE COUSIN OF THE UNHAPPY CHILD WHO WAS MURDERED OR RATHER HIS SISTER FOR I WAS EDUCATED BY AND HAVE LIVED WITH HIS PARENTS EVER SINCE AND EVEN LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH IT MAY THEREFORE BE,14.815
66-355-0025,JUDGED INDECENT IN ME TO COME FORWARD ON THIS OCCASION BUT WHEN I SEE A FELLOW CREATURE ABOUT TO PERISH THROUGH THE COWARDICE OF HER PRETENDED FRIENDS I WISH TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK THAT I MAY SAY WHAT I KNOW OF HER CHARACTER,13.795
66-355-0026,I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACCUSED I HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER AT ONE TIME FOR FIVE AND AT ANOTHER FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS DURING ALL THAT PERIOD SHE APPEARED TO ME THE MOST AMIABLE AND BENEVOLENT OF HUMAN CREATURES,15.925
66-355-0027,SHE NURSED MADAME FRANKENSTEIN MY AUNT IN HER LAST ILLNESS WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION AND CARE AND AFTERWARDS ATTENDED HER OWN MOTHER DURING A TEDIOUS ILLNESS IN A MANNER THAT EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO KNEW HER,13.69
66-355-0028,THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED AGAINST HER I BELIEVE AND RELY ON HER PERFECT INNOCENCE SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION FOR SUCH AN ACTION AS TO THE BAUBLE ON WHICH THE CHIEF PROOF RESTS,12.895
66-355-0029,I SHOULD HAVE WILLINGLY GIVEN IT TO HER SO MUCH DO I ESTEEM AND VALUE HER A MURMUR OF APPROBATION FOLLOWED ELIZABETH'S SIMPLE AND POWERFUL APPEAL BUT IT WAS EXCITED BY HER GENEROUS INTERFERENCE AND NOT IN FAVOUR OF POOR JUSTINE,15.83
66-355-0030,ON WHOM THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION WAS TURNED WITH RENEWED VIOLENCE CHARGING HER WITH THE BLACKEST INGRATITUDE SHE HERSELF WEPT AS ELIZABETH SPOKE BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER MY OWN AGITATION AND ANGUISH WAS EXTREME DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL,16.14
66-355-0031,I BELIEVED IN HER INNOCENCE I KNEW IT COULD THE DEMON WHO HAD,4.99
66-355-0032,HAD ALREADY CONDEMNED MY UNHAPPY VICTIM I RUSHED OUT OF THE COURT IN AGONY THE TORTURES OF THE ACCUSED DID NOT EQUAL MINE SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY INNOCENCE BUT THE FANGS OF REMORSE TORE MY BOSOM AND WOULD NOT FORGO THEIR HOLD,15.995
66-355-0033,I PASSED A NIGHT OF UNMINGLED WRETCHEDNESS IN THE MORNING I WENT TO THE COURT MY LIPS AND THROAT WERE PARCHED I DARED NOT ASK THE FATAL QUESTION BUT I WAS KNOWN,12.765
66-355-0034,AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN THEY WERE ALL BLACK AND JUSTINE WAS CONDEMNED I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THEN FELT I HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED SENSATIONS OF HORROR,16.87
66-355-0035,BUT WORDS CANNOT CONVEY AN IDEA OF THE HEART SICKENING DESPAIR THAT I THEN ENDURED THE PERSON TO WHOM I ADDRESSED MYSELF ADDED THAT JUSTINE HAD ALREADY CONFESSED HER GUILT THAT EVIDENCE HE OBSERVED,13.995
66-355-0036,WAS HARDLY REQUIRED IN SO GLARING A CASE BUT I AM GLAD OF IT AND INDEED NONE OF OUR JUDGES LIKE TO CONDEMN A CRIMINAL UPON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE BE IT EVER SO DECISIVE THIS WAS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE,14.62
66-355-0037,WHAT COULD IT MEAN HAD MY EYES DECEIVED ME AND WAS I REALLY AS MAD AS THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BELIEVE ME TO BE IF I DISCLOSED THE OBJECT OF MY SUSPICIONS I HASTENED TO RETURN HOME AND ELIZABETH EAGERLY DEMANDED THE RESULT,15.105
66-355-0038,MY COUSIN REPLIED I IT IS DECIDED AS YOU MAY HAVE EXPECTED ALL JUDGES HAD RATHER THAT TEN INNOCENT SHOULD SUFFER THAN THAT ONE GUILTY SHOULD ESCAPE BUT SHE HAS CONFESSED,14.26
66-355-0039,THIS WAS A DIRE BLOW TO POOR ELIZABETH,2.935
66-355-0040,ALAS SAID SHE HOW SHALL I EVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN HUMAN GOODNESS JUSTINE WHOM I LOVED AND ESTEEMED AS MY SISTER HOW COULD SHE PUT ON THOSE SMILES OF INNOCENCE ONLY TO BETRAY HER MILD EYES SEEMED INCAPABLE OF ANY SEVERITY OR GUILE,15.36
66-355-0041,AND YET SHE HAS COMMITTED A MURDER SOON AFTER WE HEARD THAT THE POOR VICTIM HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE MY COUSIN MY FATHER WISHED HER NOT TO GO BUT SAID THAT HE LEFT IT TO HER OWN JUDGMENT AND FEELINGS TO DECIDE,15.18
66-355-0042,YES SAID ELIZABETH I WILL GO ALTHOUGH SHE IS GUILTY AND YOU VICTOR SHALL ACCOMPANY ME I CANNOT GO ALONE THE IDEA OF THIS VISIT WAS TORTURE TO ME YET I COULD NOT REFUSE,14.74
66-355-0043,SHE THREW HERSELF AT THE FEET OF ELIZABETH WEEPING BITTERLY MY COUSIN WEPT ALSO OH JUSTINE SAID SHE WHY DID YOU ROB ME OF MY LAST CONSOLATION I RELIED ON YOUR INNOCENCE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS THEN VERY WRETCHED,16.055
66-355-0044,I WAS NOT SO MISERABLE AS I AM NOW AND DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT I AM SO VERY VERY WICKED DO YOU ALSO JOIN WITH MY ENEMIES TO CRUSH ME TO CONDEMN ME AS A MURDERER HER VOICE WAS SUFFOCATED WITH SOBS,15.27
66-355-0045,RISE MY POOR GIRL SAID ELIZABETH WHY DO YOU KNEEL IF YOU ARE INNOCENT I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES I BELIEVED YOU GUILTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EVIDENCE UNTIL I HEARD THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF DECLARED YOUR GUILT,14.325
66-355-0046,THAT REPORT YOU SAY IS FALSE AND BE ASSURED DEAR JUSTINE THAT NOTHING CAN SHAKE MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU FOR A MOMENT BUT YOUR OWN CONFESSION I DID CONFESS BUT I CONFESSED A LIE,13.78
66-355-0047,I CONFESSED THAT I MIGHT OBTAIN ABSOLUTION BUT NOW THAT FALSEHOOD LIES HEAVIER AT MY HEART THAN ALL MY OTHER SINS THE GOD OF HEAVEN FORGIVE ME EVER SINCE I WAS CONDEMNED MY CONFESSOR HAS BESIEGED ME,14.335
66-355-0048,HE THREATENED AND MENACED UNTIL I ALMOST BEGAN TO THINK THAT I WAS THE MONSTER THAT HE SAID I WAS HE THREATENED EXCOMMUNICATION AND HELL FIRE IN MY LAST MOMENTS IF I CONTINUED OBDURATE,11.335
66-355-0049,ALL LOOKED ON ME AS A WRETCH DOOMED TO IGNOMINY AND PERDITION WHAT COULD I DO IN AN EVIL HOUR I SUBSCRIBED TO A LIE AND NOW ONLY AM I TRULY MISERABLE SHE PAUSED WEEPING,14.86
66-355-0050,AND THEN CONTINUED I THOUGHT WITH HORROR MY SWEET LADY,4.925
66-355-0051,AND WHOM YOU LOVED WAS A CREATURE CAPABLE OF A CRIME WHICH NONE BUT THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD HAVE PERPETRATED DEAR WILLIAM,7.9
66-355-0052,I SOON SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN IN HEAVEN WHERE WE SHALL ALL BE HAPPY AND THAT CONSOLES ME GOING AS I AM TO SUFFER IGNOMINY AND DEATH OH JUSTINE,13.07
66-355-0053,FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING FOR ONE MOMENT DISTRUSTED YOU WHY DID YOU CONFESS BUT DO NOT MOURN DEAR GIRL DO NOT FEAR I WILL PROCLAIM I WILL PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE I WILL MELT THE STONY HEARTS OF YOUR ENEMIES,14.395
66-355-0054,BY MY TEARS AND PRAYERS YOU SHALL NOT DIE YOU MY PLAYFELLOW MY COMPANION,6.39
66-355-0055,JUSTINE SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY I DO NOT FEAR TO DIE SHE SAID THAT PANG IS PAST GOD RAISES MY WEAKNESS AND GIVES ME COURAGE TO ENDURE THE WORST,11.835
66-355-0056,DURING THIS CONVERSATION I HAD RETIRED TO A CORNER OF THE PRISON ROOM WHERE I COULD CONCEAL THE HORRID ANGUISH THAT POSSESSED ME DESPAIR WHO DARED TALK OF THAT,11.14
66-355-0057,THE POOR VICTIM WHO ON THE MORROW WAS TO PASS THE AWFUL BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FELT NOT AS I DID SUCH DEEP AND BITTER AGONY I GNASHED MY TEETH AND GROUND THEM TOGETHER,12.485
66-355-0058,JUSTINE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW WHO IT WAS SHE APPROACHED ME AND SAID DEAR SIR,6.37
66-355-0059,I COULD NOT ANSWER NO JUSTINE SAID ELIZABETH HE IS MORE CONVINCED OF YOUR INNOCENCE THAN I WAS FOR EVEN WHEN HE HEARD THAT YOU HAD CONFESSED HE DID NOT CREDIT IT I TRULY THANK HIM,13.245
66-355-0060,IN THESE LAST MOMENTS I FEEL THE SINCEREST GRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO THINK OF ME WITH KINDNESS HOW SWEET IS THE AFFECTION OF OTHERS TO SUCH A WRETCH AS I AM IT REMOVES MORE THAN HALF MY MISFORTUNE,13.29
66-355-0061,AND I FEEL AS IF I COULD DIE IN PEACE NOW THAT MY INNOCENCE IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY YOU DEAR LADY AND YOUR COUSIN THUS THE POOR SUFFERER TRIED TO COMFORT OTHERS AND HERSELF,14.395
66-355-0062,SHE INDEED GAINED THE RESIGNATION SHE DESIRED BUT I THE TRUE MURDERER FELT THE NEVER DYING WORM ALIVE IN MY BOSOM WHICH ALLOWED OF NO HOPE OR CONSOLATION ELIZABETH ALSO WEPT AND WAS UNHAPPY,16.125

75-853-0017,THE CHILD WHO WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD WAS INDEED AN EXCEEDINGLY FINE LITTLE FELLOW AS HE SAT IN ONE SCANTY GARMENT IN HIS MOTHER'S LAP,9.415
75-853-0018,THE CHILD AND MOTHER MADE SHE WAS A FAIR GENTLE LOOKING GIRL SOME TWO AND TWENTY YEARS OLD AND IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO SEE NOW FROM HER DELICATE FEATURES AND SOFT SHAPELY HANDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TOIL AND NOW THE SMITH SAID,16.13
75-853-0019,THE HOUR IS LATE AND I SHALL BE HAVING THE WATCH COMING ALONG TO KNOW WHY I KEEP A FIRE SO LONG AFTER THE CURFEW SHOULD YOU BE A STRANGER IN THE CITY,7.6

75-853-0021,LAY DOWN ON THE RUSHES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE FOR IN THOSE DAYS NONE OF THE WORKING OR ARTISAN CLASS USED BEDS WHICH WERE NOT INDEED FOR CENTURIES AFTERWARDS IN USAGE BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN THE MORNING GEOFFREY WARD,15.2
75-853-0022,FOUND THAT HIS GUEST DESIRED TO FIND ONE GILES FLETCHER A MAKER OF BOWS I KNOW HIM WELL THE SMITH SAID THERE ARE MANY WHO DO A LARGER BUSINESS AND HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGHER BUT GILES FLETCHER IS WELL ESTEEMED AS A GOOD WORKMAN WHOSE WARES CAN BE DEPENDED UPON IT IS OFTEN SAID OF HIM,16.005
75-853-0023,THAT DID HE TAKE LESS PAINS HE WOULD THRIVE MORE BUT HE HANDLES EACH BOW THAT HE MAKES AS IF HE LOVED IT AND FINISHES AND POLISHES EACH WITH HIS OWN HAND THEREFORE HE DOETH NOT SO MUCH TRADE AS THOSE WHO ARE LESS PARTICULAR WITH THEIR WARES,14.605
75-853-0024,BUT NONE WHO HAVE EVER BOUGHT HIS BOWS HAVE REGRETTED THE SILVER WHICH THEY COST MANY AND MANY A GROSS OF ARROWHEADS HAVE I SOLD HIM,7.78
75-853-0025,MANY A FRIENDLY WRANGLE HAVE I HAD WITH HIM,2.66
75-853-0026,AND NOW MADAM I AM AT YOUR SERVICE DURING THE NIGHT THE WAYFARER'S CLOTHES HAD BEEN DRIED THE CLOAK WAS OF ROUGH QUALITY SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY A PEASANT WOMAN BUT THE REST THOUGH OF SOMBRE COLOUR WERE OF GOOD MATERIAL AND FASHION,14.345
75-853-0027,SEEING THAT HER KIND ENTERTAINERS WOULD BE HURT BY THE OFFER OF MONEY THE LADY CONTENTED HERSELF WITH THANKING MADGE WARMLY,7.59
75-853-0028,WITH DAME FLETCHER THEN UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF GEOFFREY WHO INSISTED ON CARRYING THE BOY SHE SET OUT FROM THE SMITH'S COTTAGE THEY PASSED UNDER THE OUTER GATE AND ACROSS THE BRIDGE WHICH LATER ON WAS COVERED WITH A DOUBLE LINE OF HOUSES AND SHOPS,14.99
75-853-0029,BUT WAS NOW A NARROW STRUCTURE OVER THE GATEWAY ACROSS THE RIVER UPON PIKES WERE A NUMBER OF HEADS AND HUMAN LIMBS THE LADY SHUDDERED AS SHE LOOKED UP,10.625
75-853-0030,WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE KING'S GRANDFATHER SOME TWENTY YEARS BACK BUT AFTER ALL THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY,7.5099375
75-853-0031,THAT MEN WHO HAVE DONE NO OTHER HARM SHOULD BE BEHEADED STILL LESS THAT THEIR HEADS AND LIMBS SHOULD BE STUCK UP THERE GIBBERING AT ALL PASSERS BY THERE ARE OVER A SCORE OF THEM AND EVERY FRESH TROUBLE ADDS TO THEIR NUMBER BUT PARDON ME,15.22
75-853-0032,HE SAID SUDDENLY AS A SOB FROM THE FIGURE BY HIS SIDE,3.315
75-853-0033,I AM ROUGH AND HEEDLESS IN SPEECH AS MY SISTER MADGE DOES OFTEN TELL ME AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT I HAVE SAID SOMETHING WHICH WOUNDED YOU,8.005
75-853-0034,SAY NOT MORE ABOUT IT I PRAY YOU THEY PASSED UNDER THE GATEWAY WITH ITS GHASTLY BURDEN AND WERE SOON IN THE CROWDED STREETS OF LONDON HIGH OVERHEAD THE HOUSES EXTENDED EACH STORY ADVANCING BEYOND THAT BELOW IT,14.26
75-853-0035,UNTIL THE OCCUPIERS OF THE ATTICS COULD WELL NIGH SHAKE HANDS ACROSS THEY SOON LEFT THE MORE CROWDED STREETS AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT AFTER TEN MINUTES WALKING THE SMITH STOPPED IN FRONT OF A BOWYER SHOP NEAR ALDGATE,14.04
75-853-0036,HERE I WILL LEAVE YOU AND WILL ONE OF THESE DAYS RETURN TO INQUIRE IF YOUR HEALTH HAS TAKEN OUGHT OF HARM BY THE ROUGH BUFFETING OF THE STORM OF YESTER EVEN SO SAYING HE HANDED THE CHILD TO ITS MOTHER,11.94
75-853-0037,WITH A BENT BOW IN HIS ARM TAKING AIM AT A SPOT IN THE WALL THROUGH AN OPEN DOOR THREE MEN COULD BE SEEN IN AN INNER WORKSHOP CUTTING AND SHAPING THE WOOD FOR BOWS THE BOWYER,12.915
75-853-0038,LOOKED ROUND AS HIS VISITOR ENTERED THE SHOP AND THEN WITH A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION LOWERED THE BOW HUSH GILES THE LADY EXCLAIMED IT IS I BUT NAME NO NAMES IT WERE BEST THAT NONE KNEW ME HERE,12.46
75-853-0039,THE CRAFTSMAN CLOSED THE DOOR OF COMMUNICATION INTO THE INNER ROOM MY LADY ALICE HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOW TONE YOU HERE AND IN SUCH A GUISE SURELY IT IS I THE LADY SIGHED ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES I AM WELL NIGH INCLINED TO ASK MYSELF,15.57
75-853-0040,I HAD HEARD BUT VAGUELY OF YOUR TROUBLES GILES FLETCHER SAID BUT HOPED THAT THE RUMOURS WERE FALSE EVER SINCE THE DUKE OF KENT WAS EXECUTED THE AIR HAS BEEN FULL OF RUMOURS THEN CAME NEWS OF THE KILLING OF MORTIMER AND OF THE IMPRISONMENT OF THE KING'S MOTHER,14.59
75-853-0041,AND IT WAS SAID THAT MANY WHO WERE THOUGHT TO BE OF HER PARTY HAD BEEN ATTACKED AND SLAIN AND I HEARD AND THERE HE STOPPED YOU HEARD RIGHTLY GOOD GILES IT IS ALL TRUE A WEEK AFTER THE SLAYING OF MORTIMER,14.0
75-853-0042,WAS TAKEN ROLAND WAS KILLED AND I WAS CAST OUT WITH MY CHILD AFTERWARDS THEY REPENTED THAT THEY HAD LET ME GO AND SEARCHED FAR AND WIDE FOR ME BUT I WAS HIDDEN IN THE COTTAGE OF A WOODCUTTER,12.02
75-853-0043,THEY WERE TOO BUSY IN HUNTING DOWN OTHERS WHOM THEY PROCLAIMED TO BE ENEMIES OF THE KING AS THEY HAD WRONGFULLY SAID OF ROLAND WHO HAD BUT DONE HIS DUTY FAITHFULLY TO QUEEN ISABELLA AND WAS ASSUREDLY NO ENEMY OF HER SON,13.155
75-853-0044,BELIEVING THAT YOU AND BERTHA WOULD TAKE ME IN AND SHELTER ME IN MY GREAT NEED AYE THAT WILL WE WILLINGLY GILES SAID WAS NOT BERTHA YOUR NURSE AND TO WHOM SHOULD YOU COME IF NOT TO HER BUT WILL IT PLEASE YOU TO MOUNT THE STAIRS FOR BERTHA WILL NOT FORGIVE ME IF I KEEP YOU TALKING DOWN HERE,16.6
75-853-0045,WHAT A JOY IT WILL BE TO HER TO SEE YOU AGAIN SO SAYING GILES LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT ABOVE THERE WAS A SCREAM OF SURPRISE AND JOY FROM HIS WIFE AND THEN GILES QUIETLY WITHDREW DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN,14.27
75-853-0046,GEOFFREY WARD ENTERED THE SHOP OF GILES FLETCHER I HAVE BROUGHT YOU TWENTY SCORE OF ARROWHEADS MASTER GILES HE SAID THEY HAVE BEEN LONGER IN HAND THAN IS USUAL WITH ME BUT I HAVE BEEN PRESSED AND HOW GOES IT WITH THE LADY WHOM I BROUGHT TO YOUR DOOR LAST WEEK,16.025
75-853-0047,SHE WAS LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH WET AND HARDSHIP AND DOUBTLESS THEY TOOK ALL THE MORE EFFECT BECAUSE SHE WAS LOW IN SPIRIT AND WEAKENED WITH MUCH GRIEVING THAT NIGHT SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SORT OF FEVER HOT AND COLD BY TURNS AND AT TIMES OFF HER HEAD,14.77
75-853-0048,AND IN TROTH MASTER WARD METHINKS THAT GOD WOULD DEAL MOST GENTLY WITH HER,4.94
75-853-0049,AND THAT BERTHA WOULD SERVE HER AS GLADLY AND FAITHFULLY AS EVER SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS HER NURSE YET SHE COULD NOT BUT GREATLY FEEL THE CHANGE SHE WAS TENDERLY BROUGHT UP BEING AS I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF SIR HAROLD BROOME,14.89
75-853-0050,HER BROTHER WHO BUT A YEAR AGO BECAME LORD OF BROOMECASTLE AT THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN AND IT WAS HE I BELIEVE WHO BROUGHT SIR ROLAND SOMERS TO THAT SIDE HE WAS SLAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT AS MORTIMER,13.635
75-853-0051,AND HIS LANDS LIKE THOSE OF SIR ROLAND HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE CROWN THE CHILD UPSTAIRS IS BY RIGHT HEIR TO BOTH ESTATES SEEING THAT HIS UNCLE DIED UNMARRIED,10.68
75-853-0052,THEY WILL DOUBTLESS BE CONFERRED UPON THOSE WHO HAVE AIDED THE YOUNG KING IN FREEING HIMSELF FROM HIS MOTHER'S DOMINATION FOR WHICH INDEED ALTHOUGH I LAMENT THAT LADY ALICE SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED SO SORELY IN THE DOING OF IT I BLAME HIM NOT AT ALL,14.43
75-853-0053,HE IS A NOBLE PRINCE AND WILL MAKE US A GREAT KING AND THE DOINGS OF HIS MOTHER HAVE BEEN A SHAME TO US ALL HOWEVER I MEDDLE NOT IN POLITICS IF THE POOR LADY DIES AS METHINKS IS WELL NIGH CERTAIN BERTHA AND I WILL BRING UP THE BOY AS OUR OWN,15.43
75-853-0054,I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH MY WIFE AND SO FAR SHE AND I ARE NOT OF ONE MIND I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO KEEP HIM IN IGNORANCE OF HIS BIRTH AND LINEAGE SINCE THE KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BENEFIT HIM AND WILL BUT RENDER HIM DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT,15.755
75-853-0055,TO TAKE TO MY CALLING IN WHICH HE MIGHT OTHERWISE,3.425
75-853-0056,BUT BERTHA HATH NOTIONS YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN A WIFE TO YOURSELF MASTER GEOFFREY OR YOU WOULD KNOW THAT WOMEN OFT HAVE FANCIES WHICH WANDER WIDELY FROM HARD FACTS AND SHE SAYS SHE WOULD HAVE HIM BROUGHT UP AS A MAN AT ARMS,13.79
75-853-0057,SO THAT HE MAY DO VALIANT DEEDS AND WIN BACK SOME DAY THE TITLE AND HONOUR OF HIS FAMILY GEOFFREY WARD LAUGHED,7.825
75-853-0058,YOU NEED NOT FOR THE PRESENT TROUBLE ABOUT THE CHILD'S CALLING,4.095
75-853-0059,AT ANY RATE WHETHER HE FOLLOWS YOUR TRADE,3.455
75-853-0060,THE KNOWLEDGE OF ARMS MAY WELL BE OF USE TO HIM AND I PROMISE YOU THAT SUCH SKILL AS I HAVE I WILL TEACH HIM WHEN HE GROWS OLD ENOUGH TO WIELD SWORD AND BATTLE AXE AS YOU KNOW I MAY WITHOUT BOASTING SAY,13.19
75-853-0061,THAT HE COULD SCARCE HAVE A BETTER MASTER SEEING THAT I HAVE FOR THREE YEARS CARRIED AWAY THE PRIZE FOR THE BEST SWORD PLAYER AT THE SPORTS,8.675
75-853-0062,AS TO ARCHERY HE NEED NOT GO FAR TO LEARN IT SINCE YOUR APPRENTICE WILL PARKER LAST YEAR WON THE PRIZE AS THE BEST MARKSMAN IN THE CITY BOUNDS TRUST ME,11.145
75-853-0063,THE RUMOURS THAT WE ARE LIKELY ERE LONG TO HAVE WAR WITH FRANCE HAVE RARELY BETTERED MY TRADE SINCE THE WARS IN SCOTLAND MEN'S ARMS HAVE RUSTED SOMEWHAT,11.06
75-853-0064,AND MY TWO MEN ARE HARD AT WORK MENDING ARMOUR AND FITTING SWORDS TO HILTS AND FORGING PIKE HEADS YOU SEE,8.04
75-853-0065,THE FEVER ABATED BUT LEFT HER PROSTRATE IN STRENGTH FOR A FEW WEEKS SHE LINGERED,5.77
75-853-0066,TEACH HIM TO BE HONEST AND TRUE IT WERE BETTER METHINKS THAT HE GREW UP THINKING YOU HIS FATHER AND MOTHER FOR OTHERWISE HE MAY GROW DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT,11.285
75-853-0067,AS YOU SEE HIS DISPOSITION AND MIND IF HE IS CONTENT TO SETTLE DOWN TO A PEACEFUL LIFE HERE SAY NOUGHT TO HIM WHICH WOULD UNSETTLE HIS MIND BUT IF WALTER TURN OUT TO HAVE AN ADVENTUROUS DISPOSITION,12.735
75-853-0068,OF HIS HISTORY NOT ENCOURAGING HIM TO HOPE TO RECOVER HIS FATHER'S LANDS AND MINE FOR THAT CAN NEVER BE SEEING THAT BEFORE THAT TIME CAN COME THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENJOYED FOR MANY YEARS BY OTHERS BUT THAT HE MAY LEARN TO BEAR HIMSELF BRAVELY,15.6
75-853-0069,AND GENTLY AS BECOMES ONE OF GOOD BLOOD A FEW DAYS LATER LADY ALICE BREATHED HER LAST AND AT HER OWN REQUEST WAS BURIED QUIETLY AND WITHOUT POMP AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF THE BOWMAN,14.715
75-853-0070,A PLAIN STONE WITH THE NAME DAME ALICE SOMERS MARKING THE GRAVE THE BOY GREW AND THROVE UNTIL AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THERE WAS NO STRONGER OR STURDIER LAD OF HIS AGE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDS,13.96
75-853-0071,GILES HAD CAUSED HIM TO BE TAUGHT TO READ AND WRITE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH WERE COMMON AMONG THE CITIZENS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE UNTIL LONG AFTERWARDS RARE AMONG THE WARLIKE BARONS THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME HOWEVER,13.7
75-853-0072,OFTTIMES GROWING INTO EARNEST WERE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE LADS OF THE DIFFERENT WARDS WALTER FLETCHER AS HE WAS KNOWN AMONG HIS PLAY FELLOWS,8.6600625
75-853-0073,WON FOR HIMSELF THE PROUD POSITION OF CAPTAIN OF THE BOYS OF THE WARD OF ALDGATE GEOFFREY WARD HAD KEPT HIS WORD AND HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO GIVE THE LAD LESSONS IN THE USE OF ARMS WHEN NOT ENGAGED OTHERWISE WALTER WOULD ALMOST EVERY AFTERNOON,14.88
75-853-0074,CROSS LONDON BRIDGE AND WOULD SPEND HOURS IN THE ARMOURER'S FORGE,4.085
75-853-0075,AS SOON AS THE BOY COULD HANDLE A LIGHT TOOL GEOFFREY ALLOWED HIM TO WORK AND ALTHOUGH NOT ABLE TO WIELD THE HEAVY SLEDGE WALTER WAS ABLE TO DO MUCH OF THE FINER WORK,10.245
75-853-0076,IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD TAKE HIM SOME DAY AS HIS PARTNER IN THE FORGE AFTER WORK WAS OVER AND THE MEN HAD GONE AWAY,7.33
75-853-0077,THAT HE RAPIDLY ACQUIRED THEIR USE AND GEOFFREY FORESAW THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY SHOULD HIS THOUGHTS TURN THAT WAY PROVE A MIGHTY MAN AT ARMS,9.96
75-853-0078,WHICH HAD MUCH TO DO WITH WALTER'S POSITION AMONG HIS COMRADES THE SKILL AND STRENGTH WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN WIELDING THE HAMMER AND BY PRACTICE WITH THE SWORD RENDERED HIM A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WITH THE STICKS WHICH FORMED THE WEAPONS IN THE MIMIC BATTLES,14.94
75-853-0079,AND INDEED NOT A FEW WERE THE COMPLAINTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT BEFORE GILES FLETCHER OF BRUISES AND HURTS CAUSED BY HIM YOU ARE TOO TURBULENT WALTER THE BOWYER SAID ONE DAY WHEN A HABERDASHER FROM THE WARD OF ALDERSGATE CAME TO COMPLAIN,15.315
75-853-0080,THAT HIS SON'S HEAD HAD BEEN BADLY CUT BY A BLOW WITH A CLUB FROM WALTER FLETCHER,4.605
75-853-0081,WHY DO YOU NOT PLAY MORE QUIETLY THE FEUDS BETWEEN THE BOYS OF DIFFERENT WARDS ARE BECOMING A SERIOUS NUISANCE AND MANY INJURIES HAVE BEEN INFLICTED,8.23
75-853-0082,THAT NO BOY NOT YET APPRENTICED TO A TRADE,2.84
75-853-0083,I DON'T WANT TO BE TURBULENT WALTER SAID,2.96
75-853-0084,MY FATHER IS TALKING OF APPRENTICING ME MASTER GEOFFREY WALTER SAID THAT EVENING I HOPE THAT YOU WILL AS YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO PROMISE TALK WITH HIM ABOUT APPRENTICING ME TO YOUR CRAFT RATHER THAN TO HIS I SHOULD NEVER TAKE TO THE MAKING OF BOWS,14.34
75-853-0085,THOUGH INDEED I LIKE WELL TO USE THEM AND WILL PARKER WHO IS TEACHING ME SAYS THAT I SHOW RARE PROMISE BUT IT WOULD NEVER BE TO MY TASTE TO STAND ALL DAY SAWING AND SMOOTHING AND POLISHING ONE BOW IS TO ME MUCH LIKE ANOTHER THOUGH MY FATHER HOLDS THAT THERE ARE RARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM,16.98
75-853-0086,BUT SOME DAY MASTER GEOFFREY WHEN I HAVE SERVED MY TIME I MEAN TO FOLLOW THE ARMY THERE IS ALWAYS WORK THERE FOR ARMOURERS TO DO AND SOMETIMES AT A PINCH THEY MAY EVEN GET THEIR SHARE OF FIGHTING WALTER DID NOT VENTURE TO SAY THAT HE WOULD PREFER TO BE A MAN AT ARMS,16.07
75-853-0087,HE SHOULD LONG TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN THE FIELD HE SAID NOTHING OF THIS HOWEVER BUT RENEWED HIS PROMISE TO SPEAK TO GILES FLETCHER,7.875
75-854-0000,HAD DRIVEN THE OTHER OFF FROM A HEAP OF RUBBISH WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED WITHOUT THE WALLS EACH PARTY HAD A FLAG ATTACHED TO A STICK AND THE BOYS WERE ARMED WITH CLUBS SUCH AS THOSE CARRIED BY THE APPRENTICE BOYS MANY OF THEM CARRIED MIMIC SHIELDS MADE OF WOOD,14.595
75-854-0001,SEE THE BLOOD IS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE ONE WOULD SCARCELY EXPECT TO SEE THESE VARLETS OF THE CITY PLAYING SO ROUGHLY THE CITIZENS HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES STURDY FIGHTERS BEFORE NOW MY PRINCE THE OTHER SAID THEY ARE EVER INDEPENDENT AND HOLD TO THEIR RIGHTS EVEN AGAINST THE KING,17.055

75-854-0004,STAND YOU COWARDS RALLY ROUND YOUR LEADER AND IN HIS ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNG PRINCE URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT BUT THE ASSAILANTS WERE MASTERED,10.8
75-854-0005,HEAVY BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED AND BLOOD FLOWED FREELY FROM MANY OF THEIR HEADS AND FACES FOR IN THOSE DAYS BOYS THOUGHT LESS THAN THEY DO NOW OF HARD KNOCKS AND MANLINESS AND COURAGE WERE CONSIDERED THE FIRST OF VIRTUES,14.865
75-854-0006,THOUGH HARDLY PRESSED ON ALL SIDES,2.88
75-854-0007,IN VAIN HIS FOLLOWERS ATTEMPTED TO COME TO HIS RESCUE EACH TIME THEY STRUGGLED UP THE HEAP THEY WERE BEATEN BACK AGAIN BY THOSE ON THE CREST,7.93

75-854-0009,HITHERTO THE LADS ABSORBED IN THEIR STRIFE HAD PAID BUT LITTLE HEED TO THE PARTY OF ONLOOKERS BUT AT THE WORD,7.535
75-854-0010,AND BARING THEIR HEADS STOOD STILL IN CONFUSION NO HARM IS DONE THE PRINCE SAID,5.73
75-854-0011,HE MOVES NOT LIFT HIS HEAD FROM THE GROUND THE BOY WAS INDEED STILL INSENSIBLE MY LORDS THE PRINCE SAID TO THE KNIGHTS WHO HAD NOW RIDDEN UP I FEAR THAT THIS BOY IS BADLY HURT,12.525

75-854-0024,THAT WALTER SHOULD BE APPRENTICED TO HIM THAN HE HAD EXPECTED THE BOWYER INDEED WAS A QUIET MAN,5.63
75-854-0025,GAVE HIM SO MUCH UNEASINESS THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING HIM IN ORDER SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY GEOFFREY MOREOVER HE COULD NOT BUT AGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THE PROMISE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES OFFERED A MORE FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR WALTER,16.48
75-854-0026,TO ENTER UPON THE CAREER OF ARMS AND SO PERHAPS SOMEDAY TO WIN HIS WAY BACK TO RANK AND HONOURS THAN COULD HAVE BEEN LOOKED FOR THEREFORE ON THE FOLLOWING WEEK WALTER WAS INDENTURED TO THE ARMOURER AND AS WAS USUAL AT THE TIME,14.73
75-854-0027,HIS FRAME AND MUSCLES DEVELOPED WITH LABOUR AND HE WAS NOW ABLE TO SWING ALL SAVE THE VERY HEAVIEST HAMMERS IN THE SHOP HE HAD NEVER ABATED IN HIS PRACTICE AT ARMS AND EVERY DAY WHEN WORK WAS OVER,12.7500625
75-854-0028,HE AND HIS MASTER HAD A LONG BOUT TOGETHER WITH CUDGEL OR QUARTERSTAFF SWORD OR AXE,6.985
75-854-0029,THAT GEOFFREY WARD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE NEEDED TO PUT OUT ALL HIS SKILL TO HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIS PUPIL BUT IT WAS NOT ALONE WITH GEOFFREY THAT WALTER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING THE USE OF ARMS WHENEVER A SOLDIER RETURNED FROM THE WARS,14.275
75-854-0030,WHOM GEOFFREY REPRESENTED AS BEING EAGER TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE SWORD AS WELL AS HOW TO MAKE IT THUS WALTER BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO DIFFERENT STYLES OF FIGHTING,10.365
75-854-0031,AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN WALTER HAD WON THE PRIZE AT THE SPORTS BOTH FOR THE BEST CUDGEL PLAY AND THE BEST SWORD AND BUCKLER PLAY AMONG THE APPRENTICES TO THE GREAT DISGUST OF MANY WHO HAD ALMOST REACHED THE AGE OF MANHOOD AND WERE JUST OUT OF THEIR TIME,15.79
75-854-0032,ON SUNDAYS WALTER ALWAYS SPENT THE DAY WITH GILES FLETCHER AND HIS WIFE GOING TO MASS WITH THEM AND WALKING IN THE FIELDS WHERE,9.75
75-854-0033,HE HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE FIGHTS AND FROLICS OF HIS FORMER COMRADES HE WAS IN FACT FAR TOO TIRED AT THE END OF HIS DAY'S WORK TO HAVE ANY DESIRE TO DO AUGHT BUT TO SIT AND LISTEN TO THE TALES OF THE WARS,16.145
75-854-0034,LIKING BETTER TO HANG ABOUT TAVERNS DRINKING AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY RELATED FABULOUS TALES OF THE GALLANT ACTIONS THEY HAD PERFORMED MANY TOO WANDERED OVER THE COUNTRY SOMETIMES IN TWOS OR THREES SOMETIMES IN LARGE BANDS,16.455
75-854-0035,FOR GREAT TRACTS OF FORESTS STILL COVERED A LARGE PORTION OF THE COUNTRY,4.195
75-854-0036,IN THE COUNTRY ROUND LONDON THESE PESTS WERE VERY NUMEROUS FOR HERE MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE WAS THERE A CHANCE OF PLUNDER,7.625
75-854-0037,SINCE SEARCHERS COULD BE SEEN APPROACHING A LONG WAY OFF AND ESCAPE COULD BE MADE BY PATHS ACROSS THE SWAMP,6.04
75-854-0038,FURTHER SOUTH IN THE WILD COUNTRY ROUND WESTERHAM WHERE MILES OF HEATH AND FOREST STRETCHED AWAY IN ALL DIRECTIONS WAS ANOTHER NOTED PLACE,9.87
75-854-0039,THE LAWS IN THOSE DAYS WERE EXTREMELY SEVERE AND DEATH WAS THE PENALTY OF THOSE CAUGHT PLUNDERING THE EXTREME SEVERITY OF THE LAWS HOWEVER OPERATED IN FAVOUR OF ITS BREAKERS,11.535
75-854-0040,OR GIVE TESTIMONY WHICH WOULD COST THE LIFE OF A FELLOW CREATURE THE CITIZENS OF LONDON WERE LOUD IN THEIR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DISCHARGED SOLDIERS,9.875
75-854-0041,AND IT WAS ON THEIR PETITIONS TO THE KING THAT THE SHERIFFS OF MIDDLESEX,3.795
75-854-0042,WERE GENERALLY STIRRED UP TO PUT DOWN THE ILL DOERS SOMETIMES THESE HUNTS WERE CONDUCTED IN A WHOLESALE WAY AND THE WHOLE POSSE OF A COUNTY WOULD BE CALLED OUT THEN ALL FOUND WITHIN ITS LIMITS,14.39
75-854-0043,WHEN THEY FOUND THE COUNTRY BECOMING TOO HOT FOR THEM THESE MEN WOULD TAKE SERVICE WITH SOME KNIGHT OR NOBLE GOING TO THE WAR ANXIOUS TO TAKE WITH HIM AS STRONG A FOLLOWING AS MIGHT BE AND NOT TOO PARTICULAR AS TO THE CHARACTER OF HIS SOLDIERS,15.55
75-854-0044,WALTER BEING OF AN ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WAS SOMETIMES WONT OF A SUMMER EVENING WHEN HIS WORK WAS DONE TO WANDER ACROSS THE MARSHES TAKING WITH HIM HIS BOW AND ARROWS AND OFTEN BRINGING HOME A WILD DUCK OR TWO WHICH HE SHOT IN THE POOLS,14.645
75-854-0045,MORE THAN ONCE SURLY MEN HAD ACCOSTED HIM AND HAD THREATENED TO KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD IF THEY AGAIN FOUND HIM WANDERING THAT WAY BUT WALTER LAUGHED AT THEIR THREATS,9.99
75-854-0046,THEY WERE CONTENT TO LEAVE HIM ALONE ONE DAY,3.83
75-854-0047,HE SAW A FIGURE MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THE HOUR WAS ALREADY LATE AND THE NIGHT WAS FALLING AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE MAN WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE USUAL DENIZENS OF THE SWAMP,13.305
75-854-0048,THAT WALTER WONDERED WHAT BUSINESS THERE MIGHT BE SCARCELY KNOWING WHY HE DID SO WALTER THREW HIMSELF DOWN AMONG SOME LOW BRUSHWOOD AND WATCHED THE APPROACHING FIGURE WHEN HE CAME NEAR,14.92
75-854-0049,HE RECOGNIZED THE FACE AND SAW TO HIS SURPRISE THAT IT WAS A KNIGHT,5.045
75-854-0050,HE HAD PARTICULARLY NOTICED HIM BECAUSE OF THE ARROGANT MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE WALTER HAD HIMSELF PUT IN THE RIVETS AND HAD THOUGHT AS HE BUCKLED ON THE ARMOUR AGAIN HOW UNPLEASANT A COUNTENANCE WAS THAT OF ITS WEARER,14.085
75-854-0051,HE WAS A TALL AND POWERFUL MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDSOME HAD NOT HIS EYES BEEN TOO CLOSELY SET TOGETHER HIS NOSE WAS NARROW AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE REMINDED WALTER OF A HAWK,14.85
75-854-0052,IT IS ASSUREDLY NO BUSINESS OF MINE BUT IT MAY LEAD TO AN ADVENTURE AND I HAVE HAD NO REAL FUN SINCE I LEFT ALDGATE I WILL FOLLOW,9.415
75-854-0053,THE KNIGHT PAUSED AND LOOKED ROUND AS IF UNCERTAIN OF HIS WAY,4.79
75-854-0054,WALTER SAW A FIGURE APPEAR ABOVE SOME BUSHES SOME FOUR HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT THE KNIGHT AT ONCE DIRECTED HIS STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION AND WALTER CREPT CAUTIOUSLY AFTER HIM A PEST UPON THESE SWAMPS AND QUAGMIRES THE KNIGHT SAID ANGRILY AS HE NEARED THE OTHER,16.945
75-854-0055,FOR THE LIGHT IS WANING FAST IT WERE ILL FOR ANYONE I CAUGHT PRYING ABOUT HERE BUT COME IN SIR KNIGHT MY HOVEL IS NOT WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP IS ACCUSTOMED TO BUT WE MAY AS WELL TALK THERE AS HERE BENEATH THE SKY THE TWO MEN DISAPPEARED FROM WALTER'S SIGHT THE LATTER,15.86
75-854-0056,HE WAS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DISAPPEARANCE THEN HE SAW THAT THE SPOT ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY A MERE CLUMP OF BUSHES NO HIGHER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS REALLY AN ELEVATED HUMMOCK OF GROUND,13.345
75-854-0057,WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY AMONG THEM IN THE CENTRE HOWEVER THE GROUND HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND A LOW DOORWAY ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE BUSHES GAVE ACCESS INTO A HALF SUBTERRANEAN HUT,14.595
75-854-0058,THE ROOF WAS FORMED OF AN OLD BOAT TURNED BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THIS HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BROWN TURF IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PLACE OF CONCEALMENT,9.29
75-854-0059,WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY CONCEALED WITHIN THEM A CLEVER HIDING PLACE WALTER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF NO WONDER THE POSSE SEARCH THESE SWAMPS IN VAIN THIS IS THE LOWEST AND WETTEST PART OF THE SWAMP AND WOULD BE BUT LIGHTLY SEARCHED,15.2
75-854-0060,FOR NONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT THERE WAS A HUMAN HABITATION AMONG THESE BROWN DITCHES AND STAGNANT POOLS TO HIS DISAPPOINTMENT THE LAD COULD HEAR NOTHING OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS GOING ON WITHIN THE HUT THE MURMUR OF VOICES CAME TO HIS EAR BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE,15.29
75-854-0061,IF ONE BOAT RUNS INTO ANOTHER NO ONE NEED BE SURPRISED,3.97
75-854-0062,I WOULD NOT GIVE MUCH FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU TRIED TO FIND THE WAY ALONE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN YOU GOT ME OFF FROM BEING HUNG AFTER THAT LITTLE AFFAIR AT BRUGES,8.48
75-854-0063,YOU MAY BE SURE THE KNIGHT REPLIED,2.3000625
75-854-0064,IS ALWAYS HANDY IN TIMES LIKE THESE,2.415
75-854-0065,DID IT NOT STRIKE YOU SIR KNIGHT THAT IT MIGHT ENTER MY MIND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY ADVISABLE FOR ME TO FREE MYSELF FROM ONE WHO STANDS TOWARDS ME IN THAT RELATION,10.15
75-854-0066,THAT MATTER DID NOT TROUBLE ME I KNEW BETTER THAN TO BRING MONEY INTO THIS SWAMP OF YOURS WHEN I MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY HALF A DOZEN RUFFIANS LIKE YOURSELF,10.06
75-854-0067,BIDDING HIM IN CASE I CAME NOT BACK TO SET A HUE AND CRY ON FOOT,4.535
75-854-0068,WITH THE ESPECIAL DESCRIPTION OF YOUR WORTHY SELF WALTER COULD HEAR NO MORE HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS SHOES AND FOLLOWED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND THEIR VOICES STILL ACTED AS A GUIDE TO HIM THROUGH THE SWAMP BUT HE FEARED TO KEEP TOO CLOSE,14.375
75-854-0069,AS ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS WOULD CONCEAL HIS FIGURE HE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT TREAD IN A POOL OR DITCH AND SO BETRAY HIS PRESENCE PUTTING HIS FOOT EACH TIME TO THE GROUND WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION HE MOVED QUIETLY AFTER THEM,14.595
75-854-0070,THEY SPOKE LITTLE MORE BUT THEIR HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ON THE SWAMPY GROUND WERE A SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE FOR HIM AT LAST,6.73
75-854-0071,AND THEN HE HEARD RETURNING STEPS HE DREW ASIDE A FEW FEET AND CROUCHED DOWN SAW A DIM FIGURE PASS THROUGH THE MIST AND THEN RESUMED HIS WAY THE GROUND WAS FIRMER NOW AND REPLACING HIS SHOES HE WALKED BRISKLY ON,14.765
75-854-0072,THE MARSHES SEARCHED FROM END TO END AND ALL FOUND THERE SHOULD BE KNOCKED ON HEAD AND THROWN INTO THEIR OWN DITCHES THERE WOULD BE NO FEAR OF ANY HONEST MAN COMING TO HIS END THEREBY BUT NOW TO BED LAD,11.83
75-854-0073,AND THE FIRE MUST BE ALIGHT AT DAYBREAK ON HIS WAY BACK,4.01
75-854-0074,WHETHER TO INFORM HIS MASTER OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE WAS HOWEVER BENT UPON HAVING AN ADVENTURE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND,6.835
75-854-0075,AND TWO OF THE PARTY TAKING OARS THEY STARTED UP THE RIVER NOW I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE BENT ON WALTER SAID FROM SOME WORDS I OVERHEARD,9.845
75-854-0076,ARE THIS EVENING GOING TO MAKE AN ATTACK UPON A BOAT WITH A LADY IN IT COMING DOWN THE RIVER WE WILL BE ON THE SPOT,7.6
75-854-0077,I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA I ONLY CAUGHT A FEW WORDS AND MAY BE WRONG,4.805
75-854-0078,THE TIDE WAS RUNNING DOWN STRONGLY,2.395
75-854-0079,IT WAS FINE NOW BUT THE STREAM WAS RUNNING DOWN THICK AND TURBID,4.145
75-854-0080,THEY ROWED BY TURNS ALL WERE FAIRLY EXPERT AT THE EXERCISE FOR IN THOSE DAYS THE THAMES WAS AT ONCE THE GREAT HIGHWAY AND PLAYGROUND OF LONDON,9.785
75-854-0081,OF ITALY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES WHILE FROM ABOVE THE GRAIN NEEDED FOR THE WANTS OF THE GREAT CITY WAS FLOATED DOWN IN BARGES FROM THE WEST,8.575
77-121518-0000,AND NOW AS DAWN ROSE FROM HER COUCH BESIDE TITHONUS HARBINGER OF LIGHT ALIKE TO MORTALS AND IMMORTALS THE GODS MET IN COUNCIL AND WITH THEM JOVE THE LORD OF THUNDER WHO IS THEIR KING,15.42
77-121518-0001,THEREON MINERVA BEGAN TO TELL THEM OF THE MANY SUFFERINGS OF ULYSSES FOR SHE PITIED HIM AWAY THERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE NYMPH CALYPSO FATHER JOVE SAID SHE,13.925
77-121518-0002,AND ALL YOU OTHER GODS THAT LIVE IN EVERLASTING BLISS I HOPE THERE MAY NEVER BE SUCH A THING AS A KIND AND WELL DISPOSED RULER ANY MORE NOR ONE WHO WILL GOVERN EQUITABLY I HOPE,14.53
77-121518-0003,FOR THERE IS NOT ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS BUT HAS FORGOTTEN ULYSSES WHO RULED THEM AS THOUGH HE WERE THEIR FATHER THERE HE IS LYING IN GREAT PAIN IN AN ISLAND WHERE DWELLS THE NYMPH CALYPSO,15.565
77-121518-0004,WHO WILL NOT LET HIM GO AND HE CANNOT GET BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR HE CAN FIND NEITHER SHIPS NOR SAILORS TO TAKE HIM OVER THE SEA FURTHERMORE,10.97
77-121518-0005,WICKED PEOPLE ARE NOW TRYING TO MURDER HIS ONLY SON TELEMACHUS WHO IS COMING HOME FROM PYLOS AND LACEDAEMON,8.505
77-121518-0006,OF HIS FATHER WHAT MY DEAR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT REPLIED HER FATHER DID YOU NOT SEND HIM THERE YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP ULYSSES TO GET HOME AND PUNISH THE SUITORS,13.885
77-121518-0007,BESIDES YOU ARE PERFECTLY ABLE TO PROTECT TELEMACHUS AND TO SEE HIM SAFELY HOME AGAIN WHILE THE SUITORS HAVE TO COME HURRY SKURRYING BACK WITHOUT HAVING KILLED HIM,12.775
77-121518-0008,WHEN HE HAD THUS SPOKEN HE SAID TO HIS SON MERCURY MERCURY YOU ARE OUR MESSENGER GO THEREFORE AND TELL CALYPSO WE HAVE DECREED THAT POOR ULYSSES IS TO RETURN HOME,13.685
77-121518-0009,HE IS TO BE CONVOYED NEITHER BY GODS NOR MEN BUT AFTER A PERILOUS VOYAGE OF TWENTY DAYS UPON A RAFT,8.085
77-121518-0010,WHO ARE NEAR OF KIN TO THE GODS AND WILL HONOUR HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE ONE OF OURSELVES THEY WILL SEND HIM IN A SHIP TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WILL GIVE HIM MORE BRONZE AND GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY,14.575
77-121518-0011,ALL HIS PRIZE MONEY AND HAD GOT HOME WITHOUT DISASTER THIS IS HOW WE HAVE SETTLED THAT HE SHALL RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY AND HIS FRIENDS THUS HE SPOKE AND MERCURY GUIDE AND GUARDIAN SLAYER OF ARGUS,15.94
77-121518-0012,DID AS HE WAS TOLD FORTHWITH HE BOUND ON HIS GLITTERING GOLDEN SANDALS WITH WHICH HE COULD FLY LIKE THE WIND OVER LAND AND SEA HE TOOK THE WAND WITH WHICH HE SEALS MEN'S EYES IN SLEEP,14.225
77-121518-0013,OR WAKES THEM JUST AS HE PLEASES,2.765
77-121518-0014,WHOSE WAVES HE SKIMMED LIKE A CORMORANT THAT FLIES FISHING EVERY HOLE AND CORNER OF THE OCEAN AND DRENCHING ITS THICK PLUMAGE IN THE SPRAY HE FLEW AND FLEW OVER MANY A WEARY WAVE BUT WHEN AT LAST,13.735
77-121518-0015,HE GOT TO THE ISLAND WHICH WAS HIS JOURNEY'S END HE LEFT THE SEA AND WENT ON BY LAND TILL HE CAME TO THE CAVE WHERE THE NYMPH CALYPSO LIVED HE FOUND HER AT HOME THERE WAS A LARGE FIRE BURNING ON THE HEARTH,15.77
77-121518-0016,AND ONE COULD SMELL FROM FAR THE FRAGRANT REEK OF BURNING CEDAR AND SANDAL WOOD AS FOR HERSELF SHE WAS BUSY AT HER LOOM SHOOTING HER GOLDEN SHUTTLE THROUGH THE WARP AND SINGING BEAUTIFULLY ROUND HER CAVE THERE WAS A THICK WOOD OF ALDER,15.89
77-121518-0017,POPLAR AND SWEET SMELLING CYPRESS TREES WHEREIN ALL KINDS OF GREAT BIRDS HAD BUILT THEIR NESTS OWLS HAWKS AND CHATTERING SEA CROWS THAT OCCUPY THEIR BUSINESS IN THE WATERS,11.875
77-121518-0018,A VINE LOADED WITH GRAPES WAS TRAINED AND GREW LUXURIANTLY ABOUT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE,6.4
77-121518-0019,AND TURNED HITHER AND THITHER,1.975
77-121518-0020,SO MERCURY STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT IT BUT WHEN HE HAD ADMIRED IT SUFFICIENTLY HE WENT INSIDE THE CAVE CALYPSO KNEW HIM AT ONCE FOR THE GODS ALL KNOW EACH OTHER NO MATTER HOW FAR THEY LIVE FROM ONE ANOTHER,14.295
77-121518-0021,BUT ULYSSES WAS NOT WITHIN HE WAS ON THE SEA SHORE AS USUAL LOOKING OUT UPON THE BARREN OCEAN WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES GROANING AND BREAKING HIS HEART FOR SORROW CALYPSO GAVE MERCURY A SEAT AND SAID,14.575
77-121518-0022,WHY HAVE YOU COME TO SEE ME MERCURY HONOURED AND EVER WELCOME FOR YOU DO NOT VISIT ME OFTEN SAY WHAT YOU WANT I WILL DO IT FOR YOU AT ONCE IF I CAN AND IF IT CAN BE DONE AT ALL BUT COME INSIDE,14.965
77-121518-0023,AND LET ME SET REFRESHMENT BEFORE YOU AS SHE SPOKE SHE DREW A TABLE LOADED WITH AMBROSIA BESIDE HIM AND MIXED HIM SOME RED NECTAR SO MERCURY ATE AND DRANK TILL HE HAD HAD ENOUGH,11.91
77-121518-0024,AND THEN SAID WE ARE SPEAKING GOD AND GODDESS TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU ASK ME WHY I HAVE COME HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU TRULY AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO JOVE SENT ME IT WAS NO DOING OF MINE,13.335
77-121518-0025,WHO COULD POSSIBLY WANT TO COME ALL THIS WAY OVER THE SEA WHERE THERE ARE NO CITIES FULL OF PEOPLE TO OFFER ME SACRIFICES OR CHOICE HECATOMBS,8.705
77-121518-0026,HIS ORDERS HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE HERE THE MOST ILL STARRED OF ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT NINE YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF KING PRIAM AND SAILED HOME IN THE TENTH YEAR AFTER HAVING SACKED IT,11.62
77-121518-0027,SO THAT ALL HIS BRAVE COMPANIONS PERISHED AND HE ALONE WAS CARRIED HITHER BY WIND AND TIDE JOVE SAYS THAT YOU ARE TO LET THIS MAN GO AT ONCE FOR IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL NOT PERISH HERE FAR FROM HIS OWN PEOPLE,15.25
77-121518-0028,BUT SHALL RETURN TO HIS HOUSE AND COUNTRY AND SEE HIS FRIENDS AGAIN CALYPSO TREMBLED WITH RAGE WHEN SHE HEARD THIS YOU GODS SHE EXCLAIMED OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES,11.46
77-121518-0029,YOU ARE ALWAYS JEALOUS AND HATE SEEING A GODDESS TAKE A FANCY TO A MORTAL MAN AND LIVE WITH HIM IN OPEN MATRIMONY SO WHEN ROSY FINGERED DAWN MADE LOVE TO ORION,11.005
77-121518-0030,SO AGAIN WHEN CERES FELL IN LOVE WITH IASION AND YIELDED TO HIM IN A THRICE PLOUGHED FALLOW FIELD,7.32
77-121518-0031,AND NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME TOO BECAUSE I HAVE A MAN HERE I FOUND THE POOR CREATURE SITTING ALL ALONE ASTRIDE OF A KEEL FOR JOVE HAD STRUCK HIS SHIP WITH LIGHTNING AND SUNK IT IN MID OCEAN,14.13
77-121518-0032,SO THAT ALL HIS CREW WERE DROWNED WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS DRIVEN BY WIND AND WAVES ON TO MY ISLAND I GOT FOND OF HIM AND CHERISHED HIM AND HAD SET MY HEART ON MAKING HIM IMMORTAL SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GROW OLD ALL HIS DAYS,15.4
77-121518-0033,STILL I CANNOT CROSS JOVE NOR BRING HIS COUNSELS TO NOTHING THEREFORE IF HE INSISTS UPON IT LET THE MAN GO BEYOND THE SEAS AGAIN BUT I CANNOT SEND HIM ANYWHERE MYSELF FOR I HAVE NEITHER SHIPS NOR MEN WHO CAN TAKE HIM,15.015
77-121518-0034,NEVERTHELESS I WILL READILY GIVE HIM SUCH ADVICE IN ALL GOOD FAITH AS WILL BE LIKELY TO BRING HIM SAFELY TO HIS OWN COUNTRY THEN SEND HIM AWAY SAID MERCURY OR JOVE WILL BE ANGRY WITH YOU AND PUNISH YOU ON THIS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE,15.855
77-121518-0035,AND CALYPSO WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR ULYSSES FOR SHE HAD HEARD JOVE'S MESSAGE SHE FOUND HIM SITTING UPON THE BEACH WITH HIS EYES EVER FILLED WITH TEARS AND DYING OF SHEER HOME SICKNESS,10.87
77-121518-0036,THAT WOULD HAVE IT SO AS FOR THE DAY TIME HE SPENT IT ON THE ROCKS AND ON THE SEA SHORE WEEPING CRYING ALOUD FOR HIS DESPAIR AND ALWAYS LOOKING OUT UPON THE SEA,11.255
77-121518-0037,SO GO CUT SOME BEAMS OF WOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF A LARGE RAFT WITH AN UPPER DECK THAT IT MAY CARRY YOU SAFELY OVER THE SEA I WILL PUT BREAD WINE AND WATER ON BOARD TO SAVE YOU FROM STARVING I WILL ALSO GIVE YOU CLOTHES,16.1
77-121518-0038,AND WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND TO TAKE YOU HOME IF THE GODS IN HEAVEN SO WILL IT FOR THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CAN SETTLE THEM BETTER THAN I CAN ULYSSES SHUDDERED AS HE HEARD HER NOW GODDESS HE ANSWERED,14.88
77-121518-0039,NOT EVEN A WELL FOUND SHIP WITH A FAIR WIND COULD VENTURE ON SUCH A DISTANT VOYAGE NOTHING THAT YOU CAN SAY OR DO SHALL MAKE ME GO ON BOARD A RAFT UNLESS YOU FIRST SOLEMNLY SWEAR,13.01
77-121518-0040,CALYPSO SMILED AT THIS AND CARESSED HIM WITH HER HAND YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL SAID SHE BUT YOU ARE QUITE WRONG HERE MAY HEAVEN ABOVE AND EARTH BELOW BE MY WITNESSES WITH THE WATERS OF THE RIVER STYX,12.975
77-121518-0041,THAT I MEAN YOU NO SORT OF HARM AND AM ONLY ADVISING YOU TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD DO MYSELF IN YOUR PLACE I AM DEALING WITH YOU QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY,11.495
77-121518-0042,AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU WHEN SHE HAD THUS SPOKEN SHE LED THE WAY RAPIDLY BEFORE HIM AND ULYSSES FOLLOWED IN HER STEPS SO THE PAIR GODDESS AND MAN WENT ON AND ON TILL THEY CAME TO CALYPSO'S CAVE,15.61
77-121518-0043,CALYPSO SET MEAT AND DRINK BEFORE HIM OF THE FOOD THAT MORTALS EAT BUT HER MAIDS BROUGHT AMBROSIA AND NECTAR FOR HERSELF AND THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE BEFORE THEM,12.71
77-121518-0044,WHEN THEY HAD SATISFIED THEMSELVES WITH MEAT AND DRINK CALYPSO SPOKE SAYING,6.42
77-121518-0045,HE CUT DOWN TWENTY TREES IN ALL AND ADZED THEM SMOOTH SQUARING THEM BY RULE IN GOOD WORKMANLIKE FASHION MEANWHILE CALYPSO CAME BACK WITH SOME AUGERS SO HE BORED HOLES WITH THEM AND FITTED THE TIMBERS TOGETHER WITH BOLTS AND RIVETS,14.745
77-121518-0046,HE MADE THE RAFT AS BROAD AS A SKILLED SHIPWRIGHT,3.23
77-121518-0047,HE ALSO MADE A MAST WITH A YARD ARM AND A RUDDER TO STEER WITH HE FENCED THE RAFT ALL ROUND WITH WICKER HURDLES AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE WAVES AND THEN HE THREW ON A QUANTITY OF WOOD BY AND BY,12.43
77-121518-0048,CALYPSO BROUGHT HIM SOME LINEN TO MAKE THE SAILS AND HE MADE THESE TOO EXCELLENTLY MAKING THEM FAST WITH BRACES AND SHEETS LAST OF ALL WITH THE HELP OF LEVERS HE DREW THE RAFT DOWN INTO THE WATER IN FOUR DAYS,14.72
77-121518-0049,HE HAD COMPLETED THE WHOLE WORK AND ON THE FIFTH CALYPSO SENT HIM FROM THE ISLAND AFTER WASHING HIM AND GIVING HIM SOME CLEAN CLOTHES SHE GAVE HIM A GOAT SKIN FULL OF BLACK WINE AND ANOTHER LARGER ONE OF WATER,13.335
77-121518-0050,MOREOVER SHE MADE THE WIND FAIR AND WARM FOR HIM AND GLADLY DID ULYSSES SPREAD HIS SAIL BEFORE IT WHILE HE SAT AND GUIDED THE RAFT SKILFULLY BY MEANS OF THE RUDDER,10.955
77-121518-0051,ON LATE SETTING BOOTES AND ON THE BEAR WHICH MEN ALSO CALL THE WAIN AND WHICH TURNS ROUND AND ROUND WHERE IT IS FACING ORION AND ALONE NEVER DIPPING INTO THE STREAM OF OCEANUS FOR CALYPSO HAD TOLD HIM TO KEEP THIS TO HIS LEFT,15.305
77-121518-0052,DAYS SEVEN AND TEN DID HE SAIL OVER THE SEA AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH THE DIM OUTLINES OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE NEAREST PART OF THE PHAEACIAN COAST APPEARED RISING LIKE A SHIELD ON THE HORIZON,13.075
77-121518-0053,BUT KING NEPTUNE WHO WAS RETURNING FROM THE ETHIOPIANS CAUGHT SIGHT OF ULYSSES A LONG WAY OFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SOLYMI HE COULD SEE HIM SAILING UPON THE SEA AND IT MADE HIM VERY ANGRY,12.61
77-121518-0054,AND NOW HE IS CLOSE TO THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL ESCAPE FROM THE CALAMITIES THAT HAVE BEFALLEN HIM STILL HE SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF HARDSHIP YET BEFORE HE HAS DONE WITH IT,13.295
77-121518-0055,THEREON HE GATHERED HIS CLOUDS TOGETHER GRASPED HIS TRIDENT STIRRED IT ROUND IN THE SEA AND ROUSED THE RAGE OF EVERY WIND THAT BLOWS TILL EARTH SEA AND SKY WERE HIDDEN IN CLOUD AND NIGHT SPRANG FORTH OUT OF THE HEAVENS,15.96
77-121518-0056,WINDS FROM EAST SOUTH NORTH AND WEST FELL UPON HIM ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND A TREMENDOUS SEA GOT UP SO THAT ULYSSES HEART BEGAN TO FAIL HIM ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME,16.505
77-121518-0057,I AM AFRAID CALYPSO WAS RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID I SHOULD HAVE TROUBLE BY SEA BEFORE I GOT BACK HOME IT IS ALL COMING TRUE HOW BLACK IS JOVE MAKING HEAVEN WITH HIS CLOUDS AND WHAT A SEA THE WINDS ARE RAISING FROM EVERY QUARTER AT ONCE,15.83
77-121518-0058,I AM NOW SAFE TO PERISH BLEST AND THRICE BLEST WERE THOSE DANAANS WHO FELL BEFORE TROY IN THE CAUSE OF THE SONS OF ATREUS WOULD THAT I HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE DAY WHEN THE TROJANS WERE PRESSING ME SO SORELY ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF ACHILLES,15.65
77-121518-0059,AS HE SPOKE A SEA BROKE OVER HIM WITH SUCH TERRIFIC FURY THAT THE RAFT REELED AGAIN AND HE WAS CARRIED OVERBOARD A LONG WAY OFF,10.59
77-121518-0060,THAT IT BROKE THE MAST HALF WAY UP AND BOTH SAIL AND YARD WENT OVER INTO THE SEA FOR A LONG TIME ULYSSES WAS UNDER WATER,9.19
77-121518-0061,BUT AT LAST HE GOT HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER AND SPAT OUT THE BITTER BRINE THAT WAS RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE IN STREAMS IN SPITE OF ALL THIS HOWEVER,9.965
77-121518-0062,HE DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HIS RAFT BUT SWAM AS FAST AS HE COULD TOWARDS IT GOT HOLD OF IT AND CLIMBED ON BOARD AGAIN SO AS TO ESCAPE DROWNING THE SEA TOOK THE RAFT AND TOSSED IT ABOUT AS AUTUMN WINDS WHIRL THISTLEDOWN ROUND AND ROUND UPON A ROAD,15.82
77-121518-0063,IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SOUTH NORTH EAST AND WEST WINDS WERE ALL PLAYING BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK WITH IT AT ONCE,9.57
77-121518-0064,WHEN HE WAS IN THIS PLIGHT INO DAUGHTER OF CADMUS ALSO CALLED LEUCOTHEA SAW HIM SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A MERE MORTAL BUT HAD BEEN SINCE RAISED TO THE RANK OF A MARINE GODDESS,12.8
77-121518-0065,SEEING IN WHAT GREAT DISTRESS ULYSSES NOW WAS SHE HAD COMPASSION UPON HIM AND RISING LIKE A SEA GULL FROM THE WAVES TOOK HER SEAT UPON THE RAFT MY POOR GOOD MAN SAID SHE,13.07
77-121518-0066,WHY IS NEPTUNE SO FURIOUSLY ANGRY WITH YOU HE IS GIVING YOU A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE BUT FOR ALL HIS BLUSTER HE WILL NOT KILL YOU YOU SEEM TO BE A SENSIBLE PERSON DO THEN AS I BID YOU STRIP,15.21
77-121518-0067,LEAVE YOUR RAFT TO DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND AND SWIM TO THE PHAEACIAN COAST WHERE BETTER LUCK AWAITS YOU AND HERE TAKE MY VEIL AND PUT IT ROUND YOUR CHEST IT IS ENCHANTED AND YOU CAN COME TO NO HARM SO LONG AS YOU WEAR IT,15.725
77-121518-0068,AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH LAND TAKE IT OFF THROW IT BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN INTO THE SEA AND THEN GO AWAY AGAIN WITH THESE WORDS,9.46
77-121518-0069,THEN SHE DIVED DOWN AGAIN LIKE A SEA GULL AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DARK BLUE WATERS BUT ULYSSES DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY,13.485
77-121518-0070,THIS IS ONLY SOME ONE OR OTHER OF THE GODS WHO IS LURING ME TO RUIN BY ADVISING ME TO QUIT MY RAFT AT ANY RATE I WILL NOT DO SO AT PRESENT FOR THE LAND WHERE SHE SAID I SHOULD BE QUIT OF ALL TROUBLES,15.45
77-121518-0071,SEEMED TO BE STILL A GOOD WAY OFF I KNOW WHAT I WILL DO I AM SURE IT WILL BE BEST NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL STICK TO THE RAFT AS LONG AS HER TIMBERS HOLD TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE SEA BREAKS HER UP I WILL SWIM FOR IT,15.775
77-121518-0072,I DO NOT SEE HOW I CAN DO ANY BETTER THAN THIS WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS NEPTUNE SENT A TERRIBLE GREAT WAVE THAT SEEMED TO REAR ITSELF ABOVE HIS HEAD TILL IT BROKE RIGHT OVER THE RAFT,12.495
77-121518-0073,WHICH THEN WENT TO PIECES AS THOUGH IT WERE A HEAP OF DRY CHAFF TOSSED ABOUT BY A WHIRLWIND ULYSSES GOT ASTRIDE OF ONE PLANK AND RODE UPON IT AS IF HE WERE ON HORSEBACK HE THEN TOOK OFF THE CLOTHES CALYPSO HAD GIVEN HIM,14.1649375
77-121518-0074,BOUND INO'S VEIL UNDER HIS ARMS AND PLUNGED INTO THE SEA MEANING TO SWIM ON SHORE KING NEPTUNE WATCHED HIM AS HE DID SO AND WAGGED HIS HEAD MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND SAYING THERE NOW SWIM UP AND DOWN AS YOU BEST CAN,16.7800625
77-121518-0075,I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I HAVE LET YOU OFF TOO LIGHTLY ON THIS HE LASHED HIS HORSES,7.01
77-121518-0076,BUT MINERVA RESOLVED TO HELP ULYSSES SO SHE BOUND THE WAYS OF ALL THE WINDS EXCEPT ONE AND MADE THEM LIE QUITE STILL BUT SHE ROUSED A GOOD STIFF BREEZE FROM THE NORTH THAT SHOULD LAY THE WATERS TILL ULYSSES REACHED THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE HE WOULD BE SAFE,17.0
77-121518-0077,THEREON HE FLOATED ABOUT FOR TWO NIGHTS AND TWO DAYS IN THE WATER WITH A HEAVY SWELL ON THE SEA AND DEATH STARING HIM IN THE FACE BUT WHEN THE THIRD DAY BROKE THE WIND FELL AND THERE WAS A DEAD CALM WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A BREATH OF AIR STIRRING,15.47
77-121518-0078,AS HE ROSE ON THE SWELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AHEAD AND COULD SEE LAND QUITE NEAR THEN AS CHILDREN REJOICE WHEN THEIR DEAR FATHER BEGINS TO GET BETTER AFTER HAVING FOR A LONG TIME BORNE SORE AFFLICTION SENT HIM BY SOME ANGRY SPIRIT,16.065
77-121518-0079,BUT THE GODS DELIVER HIM FROM EVIL SO WAS ULYSSES THANKFUL WHEN HE AGAIN SAW LAND AND TREES AND SWAM ON WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH THAT HE MIGHT ONCE MORE SET FOOT UPON DRY GROUND,12.765
77-121518-0080,FOR THE SWELL STILL BROKE AGAINST THEM WITH A TERRIFIC ROAR EVERYTHING WAS ENVELOPED IN SPRAY THERE WERE NO HARBOURS WHERE A SHIP MIGHT RIDE NOR SHELTER OF ANY KIND BUT ONLY HEADLANDS,12.985
77-121518-0081,LOW LYING ROCKS AND MOUNTAIN TOPS ULYSSES HEART NOW BEGAN TO FAIL HIM AND HE SAID DESPAIRINGLY TO HIMSELF ALAS JOVE HAS LET ME SEE LAND AFTER SWIMMING SO FAR THAT I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE,13.455
77-121518-0082,BUT I CAN FIND NO LANDING PLACE FOR THE COAST IS ROCKY AND SURF BEATEN THE ROCKS ARE SMOOTH AND RISE SHEER FROM THE SEA WITH DEEP WATER CLOSE UNDER THEM SO THAT I CANNOT CLIMB OUT FOR WANT OF FOOT HOLD,13.16
77-121518-0083,I AM AFRAID SOME GREAT WAVE WILL LIFT ME OFF MY LEGS AND DASH ME AGAINST THE ROCKS AS I LEAVE THE WATER WHICH WOULD GIVE ME A SORRY LANDING IF ON THE OTHER HAND I SWIM FURTHER IN SEARCH OF SOME SHELVING BEACH OR HARBOUR,14.86
77-121518-0084,A HURRICANE MAY CARRY ME OUT TO SEA AGAIN SORELY AGAINST MY WILL OR HEAVEN MAY SEND SOME GREAT MONSTER OF THE DEEP TO ATTACK ME FOR AMPHITRITE,10.505
77-121518-0085,BREEDS MANY SUCH AND I KNOW THAT NEPTUNE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS A WAVE CAUGHT HIM AND TOOK HIM WITH SUCH FORCE,9.685
77-121518-0086,AGAINST THE ROCKS THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SMASHED AND TORN TO PIECES IF MINERVA HAD NOT SHOWN HIM WHAT TO DO HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE ROCK WITH BOTH HANDS AND CLUNG TO IT GROANING WITH PAIN TILL THE WAVE RETIRED SO HE WAS SAVED THAT TIME,15.065
77-121518-0087,BUT PRESENTLY THE WAVE CAME ON AGAIN AND CARRIED HIM BACK WITH IT FAR INTO THE SEA TEARING HIS HANDS AS THE SUCKERS OF A POLYPUS ARE TORN WHEN SOME ONE PLUCKS IT FROM ITS BED,10.73
77-121518-0088,AND THE STONES COME UP ALONG WITH IT EVEN SO DID THE ROCKS TEAR THE SKIN FROM HIS STRONG HANDS AND THEN THE WAVE DREW HIM DEEP DOWN UNDER THE WATER HERE,10.8
77-121518-0089,POOR ULYSSES WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY PERISHED EVEN IN SPITE OF HIS OWN DESTINY IF MINERVA HAD NOT HELPED HIM TO KEEP HIS WITS ABOUT HIM HE SWAM SEAWARD AGAIN BEYOND REACH OF THE SURF THAT WAS BEATING AGAINST THE LAND,13.47
77-121518-0090,AND AT THE SAME TIME HE KEPT LOOKING TOWARDS THE SHORE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND SOME HAVEN OR A SPIT THAT SHOULD TAKE THE WAVES ASLANT BY AND BY AS HE SWAM ON HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF A RIVER,12.74
77-121518-0091,AND HERE HE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THERE WERE NO ROCKS AND IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE WIND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A CURRENT SO HE PRAYED INWARDLY AND SAID HEAR ME O KING WHOEVER YOU MAY BE,14.005
77-121518-0092,AND SAVE ME FROM THE ANGER OF THE SEA GOD NEPTUNE FOR I APPROACH YOU PRAYERFULLY ANY ONE WHO HAS LOST HIS WAY HAS AT ALL TIMES A CLAIM EVEN UPON THE GODS,11.5
77-121518-0093,HAVE MERCY UPON ME O KING FOR I DECLARE MYSELF YOUR SUPPLIANT THEN THE GOD STAID HIS STREAM AND STILLED THE WAVES MAKING ALL CALM BEFORE HIM AND BRINGING HIM SAFELY INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HERE,14.315
77-121518-0094,AT LAST ULYSSES KNEES AND STRONG HANDS FAILED HIM FOR THE SEA HAD COMPLETELY BROKEN HIM HIS BODY WAS ALL SWOLLEN,7.965
77-121518-0095,SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER BREATHE,2.075
77-121518-0096,WHEREON INO RECEIVED IT INTO HER HANDS FROM THE WAVE THAT BORE IT TOWARDS HER THEN HE LEFT THE RIVER LAID HIMSELF DOWN AMONG THE RUSHES AND KISSED,9.4
77-121518-0097,THE BOUNTEOUS EARTH ALAS HE CRIED TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME AND HOW IS IT ALL TO END IF I STAY HERE UPON THE RIVER BED THROUGH THE LONG WATCHES OF THE NIGHT,13.135
77-121518-0098,I AM SO EXHAUSTED THAT THE BITTER COLD AND DAMP MAY MAKE AN END OF ME FOR TOWARDS SUNRISE THERE WILL BE A KEEN WIND BLOWING FROM OFF THE RIVER IF ON THE OTHER HAND I CLIMB THE HILL SIDE FIND SHELTER IN THE WOODS AND SLEEP IN SOME THICKET,15.92
77-121518-0099,I MAY ESCAPE THE COLD AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST BUT SOME SAVAGE BEAST MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND DEVOUR ME,7.37
77-121518-0100,THERE HE CREPT BENEATH TWO SHOOTS OF OLIVE THAT GREW FROM A SINGLE STOCK THE ONE AN UNGRAFTED SUCKER WHILE THE OTHER HAD BEEN GRAFTED NO WIND HOWEVER SQUALLY,11.245
77-121518-0101,FOR THERE WAS A GREAT LITTER OF DEAD LEAVES LYING ABOUT ENOUGH TO MAKE A COVERING FOR TWO OR THREE MEN EVEN IN HARD WINTER WEATHER HE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SEE THIS SO HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND HEAPED THE LEAVES ALL ROUND HIM,13.695
77-121518-0102,THEN AS ONE WHO LIVES ALONE IN THE COUNTRY FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOR HIDES A BRAND AS FIRE SEED IN THE ASHES TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM HAVING TO GET A LIGHT ELSEWHERE,9.96
77-121526-0000,THUS DID HE SPEAK AND THEY ALL HELD THEIR PEACE THROUGHOUT THE COVERED CLOISTER ENTHRALLED BY THE CHARM OF HIS STORY TILL PRESENTLY ALCINOUS BEGAN TO SPEAK ULYSSES SAID HE,14.115
77-121526-0001,NOW THAT YOU HAVE REACHED MY HOUSE I DOUBT NOT YOU WILL GET HOME WITHOUT FURTHER MISADVENTURE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST TO YOU OTHERS HOWEVER WHO COME HERE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,13.115
77-121526-0002,TO DRINK MY CHOICEST WINE AND LISTEN TO MY BARD I WOULD INSIST AS FOLLOWS,6.355
77-121526-0003,LET US NOW THEREFORE PRESENT HIM FURTHER EACH ONE OF US WITH A LARGE TRIPOD AND A CAULDRON WE WILL RECOUP OURSELVES BY THE LEVY OF A GENERAL RATE,10.775
77-121526-0004,FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF SUCH A HANDSOME PRESENT EVERY ONE APPROVED OF THIS AND THEN THEY WENT HOME TO BED EACH IN HIS OWN ABODE WHEN THE CHILD OF MORNING ROSY FINGERED DAWN APPEARED,15.3
77-121526-0005,THEY HURRIED DOWN TO THE SHIP AND BROUGHT THEIR CAULDRONS WITH THEM ALCINOUS WENT ON BOARD AND SAW EVERYTHING SO SECURELY STOWED UNDER THE SHIP'S BENCHES THAT NOTHING COULD BREAK ADRIFT AND INJURE THE ROWERS,13.385
77-121526-0006,THEN THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS TO GET DINNER AND HE SACRIFICED A BULL FOR THEM IN HONOUR OF JOVE WHO IS THE LORD OF ALL THEY SET THE STEAKS TO GRILL AND MADE AN EXCELLENT DINNER,12.045
77-121526-0007,AFTER WHICH THE INSPIRED BARD DEMODOCUS WHO WAS A FAVOURITE WITH EVERY ONE SANG TO THEM BUT ULYSSES KEPT ON TURNING HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SUN AS THOUGH TO HASTEN HIS SETTING FOR HE WAS LONGING TO BE ON HIS WAY,14.885
77-121526-0008,AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN ALL DAY PLOUGHING A FALLOW FIELD WITH A COUPLE OF OXEN KEEPS THINKING ABOUT HIS SUPPER AND IS GLAD WHEN NIGHT COMES THAT HE MAY GO AND GET IT FOR IT IS ALL HIS LEGS CAN DO TO CARRY HIM,13.18
77-121526-0009,EVEN SO DID ULYSSES REJOICE WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN AND HE AT ONCE SAID TO THE PHAEACIANS ADDRESSING HIMSELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO KING ALCINOUS SIR AND ALL OF YOU FAREWELL,13.64
77-121526-0010,AND MAKING ME PRESENTS WHICH HEAVEN GRANT THAT I MAY TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT,4.825
77-121526-0011,INASMUCH AS HE HAD SPOKEN REASONABLY ALCINOUS THEREFORE SAID TO HIS SERVANT PONTONOUS MIX SOME WINE AND HAND IT ROUND TO EVERYBODY THAT WE MAY OFFER A PRAYER TO FATHER JOVE AND SPEED OUR GUEST UPON HIS WAY,15.215
77-121526-0012,THE OTHERS EACH FROM HIS OWN SEAT MADE A DRINK OFFERING TO THE BLESSED GODS THAT LIVE IN HEAVEN,5.76
77-121526-0013,FAREWELL QUEEN SAID HE HENCEFORWARD AND FOR EVER TILL AGE AND DEATH THE COMMON LOT OF MANKIND LAY THEIR HANDS UPON YOU I NOW TAKE MY LEAVE,12.85
77-121526-0014,YOUR PEOPLE AND WITH KING ALCINOUS AS HE SPOKE HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND ALCINOUS SENT A MAN TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS SHIP AND TO THE SEA SHORE,10.955
77-121526-0015,WHEN THEY GOT TO THE WATER SIDE THE CREW TOOK THESE THINGS AND PUT THEM ON BOARD WITH ALL THE MEAT AND DRINK BUT FOR ULYSSES THEY SPREAD A RUG AND A LINEN SHEET ON DECK THAT HE MIGHT SLEEP SOUNDLY IN THE STERN OF THE SHIP,15.2650625
77-121526-0016,THEN HE TOO WENT ON BOARD AND LAY DOWN WITHOUT A WORD BUT THE CREW TOOK EVERY MAN HIS PLACE AND LOOSED THE HAWSER FROM THE PIERCED STONE TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN BOUND THEREON WHEN THEY BEGAN ROWING OUT TO SEA ULYSSES FELL INTO A DEEP,16.095
77-121526-0017,BOUNDED FORWARD ON HER WAY AS A FOUR IN HAND CHARIOT FLIES OVER THE COURSE WHEN THE HORSES FEEL THE WHIP HER PROW CURVETTED AS IT WERE THE NECK OF A STALLION AND A GREAT WAVE OF DARK BLUE WATER SEETHED IN HER WAKE,14.98
77-121526-0018,FORGETFUL OF ALL THAT HE HAD SUFFERED BOTH ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND BY THE WAVES OF THE WEARY SEA WHEN THE BRIGHT STAR THAT HERALDS THE APPROACH OF DAWN BEGAN TO SHOW,12.11
77-121526-0019,WHICH LIES BETWEEN TWO POINTS THAT BREAK THE LINE OF THE SEA AND SHUT THE HARBOUR IN,5.15
77-121526-0020,SO THAT WHEN ONCE WITHIN IT A SHIP MAY LIE WITHOUT BEING EVEN MOORED AT THE HEAD OF THIS HARBOUR THERE IS A LARGE OLIVE TREE,9.73
77-121526-0021,MOREOVER THERE ARE GREAT LOOMS OF STONE ON WHICH THE NYMPHS WEAVE THEIR ROBES OF SEA PURPLE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE AND AT ALL TIMES THERE IS WATER WITHIN IT,11.06
77-121526-0022,IT HAS TWO ENTRANCES ONE FACING NORTH BY WHICH MORTALS CAN GO DOWN INTO THE CAVE WHILE THE OTHER COMES FROM THE SOUTH AND IS MORE MYSTERIOUS MORTALS CANNOT POSSIBLY GET IN BY IT IT IS THE WAY TAKEN BY THE GODS INTO THIS HARBOUR,15.635
77-121526-0023,THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS TO LIFT ULYSSES WITH HIS RUG AND LINEN SHEET OUT OF THE SHIP AND LAY HIM DOWN UPON THE SAND STILL FAST ASLEEP,9.57
77-121526-0024,THEN THEY TOOK OUT THE PRESENTS WHICH MINERVA HAD PERSUADED THE PHAEACIANS TO GIVE HIM WHEN HE WAS SETTING OUT ON HIS VOYAGE HOMEWARDS THEY PUT THESE ALL TOGETHER BY THE ROOT OF THE OLIVE TREE AWAY FROM THE ROAD,12.04
77-121526-0025,AND THEN THEY MADE THE BEST OF THEIR WAY HOME AGAIN BUT NEPTUNE DID NOT FORGET THE THREATS WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY THREATENED ULYSSES SO HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH JOVE FATHER JOVE SAID HE,13.765
77-121526-0026,I SHALL NO LONGER BE HELD IN ANY SORT OF RESPECT AMONG YOU GODS IF MORTALS LIKE THE PHAEACIANS WHO ARE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD SHOW SUCH SMALL REGARD FOR ME,11.275
77-121526-0027,WHEN HE HAD SUFFERED SUFFICIENTLY I DID NOT SAY THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GET HOME AT ALL FOR I KNEW YOU HAD ALREADY NODDED YOUR HEAD ABOUT IT AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD DO SO,12.12
77-121526-0028,BUT NOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT HIM IN A SHIP FAST ASLEEP AND HAVE LANDED HIM IN ITHACA AFTER LOADING HIM WITH MORE MAGNIFICENT PRESENTS OF BRONZE GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD EVER HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY,12.65
77-121526-0029,IF HE HAD HAD HIS SHARE OF THE SPOIL AND GOT HOME WITHOUT MISADVENTURE AND JOVE ANSWERED WHAT O LORD OF THE EARTHQUAKE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,9.385
77-121526-0030,AS REGARDS MORTALS HOWEVER IF ANY OF THEM IS INDULGING IN INSOLENCE AND TREATING YOU DISRESPECTFULLY IT WILL ALWAYS REST WITH YOURSELF TO DEAL WITH HIM AS YOU MAY THINK PROPER SO DO JUST AS YOU PLEASE,14.755
77-121526-0031,I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO AT ONCE REPLIED NEPTUNE IF I WERE NOT ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT MIGHT DISPLEASE YOU NOW THEREFORE I SHOULD LIKE TO WRECK THE PHAEACIAN SHIP AS IT IS RETURNING FROM ITS ESCORT,13.32
77-121526-0032,THIS WILL STOP THEM FROM ESCORTING PEOPLE IN FUTURE AND I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO BURY THEIR CITY UNDER A HUGE MOUNTAIN MY GOOD FRIEND ANSWERED JOVE I SHOULD RECOMMEND YOU AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE PEOPLE FROM THE CITY ARE WATCHING THE SHIP ON HER WAY,14.885
77-121526-0033,THIS WILL ASTONISH EVERYBODY AND YOU CAN THEN BURY THEIR CITY UNDER THE MOUNTAIN WHEN EARTH ENCIRCLING NEPTUNE HEARD THIS HE WENT TO SCHERIA WHERE THE PHAEACIANS LIVE AND STAYED THERE TILL THE SHIP WHICH WAS MAKING RAPID WAY HAD GOT CLOSE IN,15.905
77-121526-0034,TURNED IT INTO STONE AND DROVE IT DOWN WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HAND SO AS TO ROOT IT IN THE GROUND AFTER THIS HE WENT AWAY THE PHAEACIANS THEN BEGAN TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES AND ONE WOULD TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR,14.47
77-121526-0035,SAYING BLESS MY HEART WHO IS IT THAT CAN HAVE ROOTED THE SHIP IN THE SEA JUST AS SHE WAS GETTING INTO PORT WE COULD SEE THE WHOLE OF HER,8.725
77-121526-0036,BUT THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND ALCINOUS SAID I REMEMBER NOW THE OLD PROPHECY OF MY FATHER HE SAID THAT NEPTUNE WOULD BE ANGRY WITH US FOR TAKING EVERY ONE SO SAFELY OVER THE SEA AND WOULD ONE DAY WRECK A PHAEACIAN SHIP,15.445
77-121526-0037,AS IT WAS RETURNING FROM AN ESCORT AND BURY OUR CITY UNDER A HIGH MOUNTAIN,4.985
77-121526-0038,IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MUST LEAVE OFF GIVING PEOPLE ESCORTS WHEN THEY COME HERE AND IN THE NEXT LET US SACRIFICE TWELVE PICKED BULLS TO NEPTUNE THAT HE MAY HAVE MERCY UPON US AND NOT BURY OUR CITY UNDER THE HIGH MOUNTAIN,14.56
77-121526-0039,WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY WERE AFRAID AND GOT READY THE BULLS,4.25
77-121526-0040,UPON HIS OWN SOIL HE HAD BEEN SO LONG AWAY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IT AGAIN MOREOVER,7.025
77-121526-0041,THE PRECIPICES AND THE GOODLY TREES APPEARED ALL CHANGED AS HE STARTED UP AND LOOKED UPON HIS NATIVE LAND SO HE SMOTE HIS THIGHS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD DESPAIRINGLY ALAS,13.715
77-121526-0042,HE EXCLAIMED AMONG WHAT MANNER OF PEOPLE AM I FALLEN ARE THEY SAVAGE AND UNCIVILISED OR HOSPITABLE AND HUMANE WHERE SHALL I PUT ALL THIS TREASURE AND WHICH WAY SHALL I GO,12.47
82-121544-0000,SO LOUD IT WOULD HAVE MADE EACH THUNDER FAINT WHICH COUNTER TO IT FOLLOWING ITS WAY MINE EYES DIRECTED WHOLLY TO ONE PLACE AFTER THE DOLOROUS DISCOMFITURE,14.05
82-121544-0001,WHEN CHARLEMAGNE THE HOLY EMPRISE LOST SO TERRIBLY ORLANDO SOUNDED NOT SHORT WHILE MY HEAD TURNED THITHERWARD I HELD WHEN MANY LOFTY TOWERS I SEEMED TO SEE WHEREAT I,15.34
82-121544-0002,MASTER SAY WHAT TOWN IS THIS AND HE TO ME BECAUSE THOU PEEREST FORTH ATHWART THE DARKNESS AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE,10.995
82-121544-0003,WELL SHALT THOU SEE IF THOU ARRIVEST THERE HOW MUCH THE SENSE DECEIVES ITSELF BY DISTANCE THEREFORE A LITTLE FASTER SPUR THEE ON,11.1050625
82-121544-0004,ONE AND ALL OF THEM AS WHEN THE FOG IS VANISHING AWAY LITTLE BY LITTLE DOTH THE SIGHT REFIGURE WHATE'ER THE MIST THAT CROWDS THE AIR CONCEALS SO PIERCING THROUGH THE DENSE AND DARKSOME AIR,15.02
82-121544-0005,MORE AND MORE NEAR APPROACHING TOW'RD THE VERGE MY ERROR FLED AND FEAR CAME OVER ME BECAUSE AS ON ITS CIRCULAR PARAPETS,10.925
82-121544-0006,E'EN THUS THE MARGIN WHICH SURROUNDS THE WELL WITH ONE HALF OF THEIR BODIES TURRETED THE HORRIBLE GIANTS WHOM JOVE MENACES E'EN NOW FROM OUT THE HEAVENS WHEN HE THUNDERS,13.09
82-121544-0007,AND I OF ONE ALREADY SAW THE FACE SHOULDERS AND BREAST AND GREAT PART OF THE BELLY,6.725
82-121544-0008,AND IF OF ELEPHANTS AND WHALES SHE DOTH NOT REPENT HER,4.11
82-121544-0009,MORE JUST AND MORE DISCREET WILL HOLD HER FOR IT FOR WHERE THE ARGUMENT OF INTELLECT IS ADDED UNTO EVIL WILL AND POWER NO RAMPART CAN THE PEOPLE MAKE AGAINST IT,12.1
82-121544-0010,HIS FACE APPEARED TO ME AS LONG AND LARGE AS IS AT ROME THE PINE CONE OF SAINT PETER'S AND IN PROPORTION WERE THE OTHER BONES SO THAT THE MARGIN WHICH AN APRON WAS DOWN FROM THE MIDDLE,14.04
82-121544-0011,SHOWED SO MUCH OF HIM ABOVE IT THAT TO REACH UP TO HIS HAIR,4.37
82-121544-0012,FOR I BEHELD THIRTY GREAT PALMS OF HIM DOWN FROM THE PLACE WHERE MAN HIS MANTLE BUCKLES,7.245
82-121544-0013,TO WHICH WERE NOT BEFITTING SWEETER PSALMS,3.605
82-121544-0014,SOUL IDIOTIC KEEP TO THY HORN AND VENT THYSELF WITH THAT WHEN WRATH OR OTHER PASSION TOUCHES THEE SEARCH ROUND THY NECK,10.635
82-121544-0015,HERE LET US LEAVE HIM AND NOT SPEAK IN VAIN FOR EVEN SUCH TO HIM IS EVERY LANGUAGE AS HIS TO OTHERS WHICH TO NONE IS KNOWN THEREFORE A LONGER JOURNEY DID WE MAKE,13.44
82-121544-0016,TURNED TO THE LEFT AND A CROSSBOW SHOT OFT WE FOUND ANOTHER FAR MORE FIERCE AND LARGE IN BINDING HIM WHO MIGHT THE MASTER BE I CANNOT SAY BUT HE HAD PINIONED CLOSE BEHIND THE RIGHT ARM AND IN FRONT THE OTHER,15.655
82-121544-0017,WITH CHAINS THAT HELD HIM SO BEGIRT ABOUT FROM THE NECK DOWN THAT ON THE PART UNCOVERED IT WOUND ITSELF AS FAR AS THE FIFTH GYRE THIS PROUD ONE WISHED TO MAKE EXPERIMENT OF HIS OWN POWER AGAINST THE SUPREME JOVE,15.735
82-121544-0018,HE SHOWED GREAT PROWESS WHAT TIME THE GIANTS TERRIFIED THE GODS THE ARMS HE WIELDED NEVER MORE HE MOVES AND I TO HIM IF POSSIBLE,12.02
82-121544-0019,I SHOULD WISH THAT OF THE MEASURELESS BRIAREUS THESE EYES OF MINE MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCE WHENCE HE REPLIED THOU SHALT BEHOLD ANTAEUS CLOSE BY HERE,12.465
82-121544-0020,WHO CAN SPEAK AND IS UNBOUND WHO AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL CRIME SHALL PLACE US,5.415
82-121544-0021,SAVE THAT HE SEEMS IN ASPECT MORE FEROCIOUS THERE NEVER WAS AN EARTHQUAKE OF SUCH MIGHT THAT IT COULD SHAKE A TOWER SO VIOLENTLY,10.33
82-121544-0022,IF I HAD NOT BEHELD THE MANACLES THEN WE PROCEEDED FARTHER IN ADVANCE,6.1
82-121544-0023,WHO FULL FIVE ELLS WITHOUT THE HEAD FORTH ISSUED FROM THE CAVERN O THOU WHO IN THE VALLEY FORTUNATE WHICH SCIPIO THE HEIR OF GLORY MADE WHEN HANNIBAL TURNED BACK WITH ALL HIS HOSTS,13.955

82-121544-0026,MAKE US NOT GO TO TITYUS NOR TYPHOEUS,4.48

82-121544-0031,I WOULD PRESS OUT THE JUICE OF MY CONCEPTION MORE FULLY BUT BECAUSE I HAVE THEM NOT NOT WITHOUT FEAR I BRING MYSELF TO SPEAK,10.4
82-121544-0032,FOR TIS NO ENTERPRISE TO TAKE IN JEST TO SKETCH THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE UNIVERSE NOR FOR A TONGUE THAT CRIES MAMMA AND BABBO,10.25

85-121551-0068,ALL OUR AFFECTIONS THAT ALONE INFLAMED ARE IN THE PLEASURE OF THE HOLY GHOST REJOICE AT BEING OF HIS ORDER FORMED AND THIS ALLOTMENT WHICH APPEARS SO LOW,10.92
85-121551-0069,THEREFORE IS GIVEN US BECAUSE OUR VOWS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND IN SOME PART VOID WHENCE I TO HER IN YOUR MIRACULOUS ASPECTS THERE SHINES I KNOW NOT WHAT OF THE DIVINE,15.54

85-121551-0075,AND ALL THAT NATURE MAKES THEN IT WAS CLEAR TO ME HOW EVERYWHERE IN HEAVEN IS PARADISE ALTHOUGH THE GRACE OF GOOD SUPREME THERE RAIN NOT IN ONE MEASURE BUT AS IT COMES TO PASS,15.475
85-121551-0076,IF ONE FOOD SATES AND FOR ANOTHER STILL REMAINS THE LONGING WE ASK FOR THIS AND THAT DECLINE WITH THANKS E'EN THUS DID I WITH GESTURE AND WITH WORD,11.625
85-121551-0077,TO LEARN FROM HER WHAT WAS THE WEB WHEREIN SHE DID NOT PLY THE SHUTTLE TO THE END A PERFECT LIFE AND MERIT HIGH IN HEAVEN A LADY O'ER US SAID SHE BY WHOSE RULE DOWN IN YOUR WORLD THEY VEST AND VEIL THEMSELVES,15.235
85-121551-0078,THAT UNTIL DEATH THEY MAY BOTH WATCH AND SLEEP BESIDE THAT SPOUSE WHO EVERY VOW ACCEPTS WHICH CHARITY CONFORMETH TO HIS PLEASURE,9.78
85-121551-0079,AND PLEDGED ME TO THE PATHWAY OF HER SECT THEN MEN ACCUSTOMED UNTO EVIL MORE THAN UNTO GOOD FROM THE SWEET CLOISTER TORE ME GOD KNOWS WHAT AFTERWARD MY LIFE BECAME,14.225
85-121551-0080,THIS OTHER SPLENDOUR WHICH TO THEE REVEALS ITSELF ON MY RIGHT SIDE AND IS ENKINDLED WITH ALL THE ILLUMINATION OF OUR SPHERE WHAT OF MYSELF I SAY APPLIES TO HER,11.44
85-121551-0081,OF THE HEART'S VEIL SHE NEVER WAS DIVESTED OF GREAT COSTANZA THIS IS THE EFFULGENCE,8.04
85-121551-0082,BROUGHT FORTH THE THIRD AND LATEST PUISSANCE THUS UNTO ME SHE SPAKE AND THEN BEGAN AVE MARIA SINGING AND IN SINGING VANISHED AS THROUGH DEEP WATER SOMETHING HEAVY,15.595
85-121551-0083,MY SIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HER,2.54
85-121551-0084,WHEN IT HAD LOST HER TURNED ROUND UNTO THE MARK OF MORE DESIRE AND WHOLLY UNTO BEATRICE REVERTED BUT SHE SUCH LIGHTNINGS FLASHED INTO MINE EYES,11.55
85-121551-0085,AND TEMPTING A FREE MAN WOULD DIE OF HUNGER ERE EITHER HE COULD BRING UNTO HIS TEETH SO WOULD A LAMB BETWEEN THE RAVENINGS OF TWO FIERCE WOLVES STAND FEARING BOTH ALIKE,12.19
85-121551-0086,HENCE IF I HELD MY PEACE MYSELF I BLAME NOT,4.18
85-121551-0087,SINCE IT MUST BE SO NOR DO I COMMEND I HELD MY PEACE BUT MY DESIRE WAS PAINTED UPON MY FACE AND QUESTIONING WITH THAT MORE FERVENT FAR THAN BY ARTICULATE SPEECH,13.2450625
85-121551-0088,BEATRICE DID AS DANIEL HAD DONE RELIEVING NEBUCHADNEZZAR FROM THE WRATH WHICH RENDERED HIM UNJUSTLY MERCILESS AND SAID WELL SEE I HOW ATTRACTETH THEE ONE AND THE OTHER WISH,13.97
85-121551-0089,SO THAT FORTH IT DOES NOT BREATHE THOU ARGUEST IF GOOD WILL BE PERMANENT THE VIOLENCE OF OTHERS FOR WHAT REASON DOTH IT DECREASE THE MEASURE OF MY MERIT AGAIN FOR DOUBTING,15.035
85-121551-0090,FURNISH THEE OCCASION SOULS SEEMING TO RETURN UNTO THE STARS ACCORDING TO THE SENTIMENT OF PLATO THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WHICH UPON THY WISH ARE THRUSTING EQUALLY AND THEREFORE FIRST WILL I TREAT THAT WHICH HATH THE MOST OF GALL,15.365
85-121551-0091,HE OF THE SERAPHIM MOST ABSORBED IN GOD MOSES AND SAMUEL AND WHICHEVER JOHN THOU MAYST SELECT I SAY AND EVEN MARY HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAVEN THEIR SEATS THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS THAT JUST APPEARED TO THEE,14.46
85-121551-0092,NOR OF EXISTENCE MORE OR FEWER YEARS BUT ALL MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE PRIMAL CIRCLE AND HAVE SWEET LIFE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES BY FEELING MORE OR LESS THE ETERNAL BREATH THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES HERE,15.04
85-121551-0093,NOT BECAUSE ALLOTTED THIS SPHERE HAS BEEN TO THEM BUT TO GIVE SIGN OF THE CELESTIAL WHICH IS LEAST EXALTED,7.03
85-121551-0094,SINCE ONLY THROUGH THE SENSE IT APPREHENDETH,2.295
85-121551-0095,ON THIS ACCOUNT,1.57
85-121551-0096,AND FEET AND HANDS TO GOD ATTRIBUTES AND MEANS SOMETHING ELSE AND HOLY CHURCH UNDER AN ASPECT HUMAN GABRIEL AND MICHAEL REPRESENT TO YOU AND HIM WHO MADE TOBIAS WHOLE AGAIN THAT WHICH TIMAEUS ARGUES OF THE SOUL,15.715
85-121551-0097,DOTH NOT RESEMBLE THAT WHICH HERE IS SEEN BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT AS HE SPEAKS HE THINKS HE SAYS THE SOUL UNTO ITS STAR RETURNS BELIEVING IT TO HAVE BEEN SEVERED THENCE WHENEVER NATURE GAVE IT AS A FORM,13.72
85-121551-0098,PERHAPS HIS BOW DOTH HIT UPON SOME TRUTH,3.02
85-121551-0099,THE OTHER DOUBT WHICH DOTH DISQUIET THEE LESS VENOM HAS FOR ITS MALEVOLENCE COULD NEVER LEAD THEE OTHERWHERE FROM ME THAT AS UNJUST OUR JUSTICE SHOULD APPEAR IN EYES OF MORTALS IS AN ARGUMENT OF FAITH,14.145
85-121551-0100,AND NOT OF SIN HERETICAL BUT STILL THAT YOUR PERCEPTION MAY BE ABLE TO THOROUGHLY PENETRATE THIS VERITY AS THOU DESIREST I WILL SATISFY THEE,11.705
85-121551-0101,IF THEIR WILL HAD BEEN PERFECT LIKE TO THAT WHICH LAWRENCE FAST UPON HIS GRIDIRON HELD AND MUTIUS MADE SEVERE TO HIS OWN HAND IT WOULD HAVE URGED THEM BACK ALONG THE ROAD WHENCE THEY WERE DRAGGED AS SOON AS THEY WERE FREE,14.58
85-121551-0102,BUT SUCH A SOLID WILL IS ALL TOO RARE AND BY THESE WORDS IF THOU HAST GATHERED THEM AS THOU SHOULDST DO THE ARGUMENT IS REFUTED THAT WOULD HAVE STILL ANNOYED THEE MANY TIMES,13.03
85-121551-0103,BUT NOW ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNS ACROSS BEFORE THINE EYES AND SUCH THAT BY THYSELF THOU COULDST NOT THREAD IT ERE THOU WOULDST BE WEARY I HAVE FOR CERTAIN PUT INTO THY MIND THAT SOUL BEATIFIED COULD NEVER LIE,14.4
85-121551-0104,FOR IT IS NEAR THE PRIMAL TRUTH AND THEN THOU FROM PICCARDA MIGHT'ST HAVE HEARD COSTANZA KEPT AFFECTION FOR THE VEIL SO THAT SHE SEEMETH HERE TO CONTRADICT ME MANY TIMES BROTHER HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT TO ESCAPE FROM PERIL,15.64
85-121551-0105,WITH RELUCTANCE THAT HAS BEEN DONE IT WAS NOT RIGHT TO DO E'EN AS ALCMAEON,5.875
85-121551-0106,THAT FORCE WITH WILL COMMINGLES AND THEY CAUSE THAT THE OFFENCES CANNOT BE EXCUSED WILL ABSOLUTE CONSENTETH NOT TO EVIL BUT IN SO FAR CONSENTETH AS IT FEARS IF IT REFRAIN,15.675
85-121551-0107,TO FALL INTO MORE HARM HENCE WHEN PICCARDA USES THIS EXPRESSION SHE MEANETH THE WILL ABSOLUTE AND I THE OTHER,9.395
85-121551-0108,SUCH WAS THE FLOWING OF THE HOLY RIVER THAT ISSUED FROM THE FOUNT WHENCE SPRINGS ALL TRUTH THIS PUT TO REST MY WISHES ONE AND ALL O LOVE OF THE FIRST LOVER,11.41
85-121551-0109,O DIVINE SAID I FORTHWITH WHOSE SPEECH INUNDATES ME AND WARMS ME SO IT MORE AND MORE REVIVES ME MY OWN AFFECTION IS NOT SO PROFOUND AS TO SUFFICE IN RENDERING GRACE FOR GRACE,13.475
85-121551-0110,WELL I PERCEIVE THAT NEVER SATED IS OUR INTELLECT UNLESS THE TRUTH ILLUME IT BEYOND WHICH NOTHING TRUE EXPANDS ITSELF IT RESTS THEREIN AS WILD BEAST IN HIS LAIR WHEN IT ATTAINS IT,13.785
85-121551-0111,AND IT CAN ATTAIN IT IF NOT THEN EACH DESIRE WOULD FRUSTRATE BE,5.54
85-121551-0112,DOUBT AT THE FOOT OF TRUTH AND THIS IS NATURE WHICH TO THE TOP FROM HEIGHT TO HEIGHT IMPELS US THIS DOTH INVITE ME,9.99
85-121551-0113,ANOTHER TRUTH WHICH IS OBSCURE TO ME I WISH TO KNOW IF MAN CAN SATISFY YOU FOR BROKEN VOWS WITH OTHER GOOD DEEDS SO THAT IN YOUR BALANCE THEY WILL NOT BE LIGHT,13.615
85-121551-0114,BEATRICE GAZED UPON ME WITH HER EYES FULL OF THE SPARKS OF LOVE AND SO DIVINE THAT OVERCOME MY POWER I TURNED MY BACK AND ALMOST LOST MYSELF WITH EYES DOWNCAST PARADISO,16.005
85-121551-0115,IF IN THE HEAT OF LOVE I FLAME UPON THEE BEYOND THE MEASURE THAT ON EARTH IS SEEN SO THAT THE VALOUR OF THINE EYES I VANQUISH MARVEL THOU NOT THEREAT FOR THIS PROCEEDS FROM PERFECT SIGHT,14.375
85-121551-0116,WHICH AS IT APPREHENDS TO THE GOOD APPREHENDED MOVES ITS FEET WELL I PERCEIVE HOW IS ALREADY SHINING INTO THINE INTELLECT THE ETERNAL LIGHT THAT ONLY SEEN ENKINDLES ALWAYS LOVE,13.725
85-121551-0117,AND IF SOME OTHER THING YOUR LOVE SEDUCE TIS NOTHING BUT A VESTIGE OF THE SAME ILL UNDERSTOOD WHICH THERE IS SHINING THROUGH THOU FAIN WOULDST KNOW,13.045
85-121551-0118,IF WITH ANOTHER SERVICE FOR BROKEN VOW CAN SUCH RETURN BE MADE AS TO SECURE THE SOUL FROM FURTHER CLAIM THIS CANTO THUS DID BEATRICE BEGIN AND AS A MAN WHO BREAKS NOT OFF HIS SPEECH,14.695
85-121551-0119,CONTINUED THUS HER HOLY ARGUMENT THE GREATEST GIFT THAT IN HIS LARGESS GOD CREATING MADE AND UNTO HIS OWN GOODNESS NEAREST CONFORMED AND THAT WHICH HE DOTH PRIZE MOST HIGHLY IS THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL,16.23
85-121551-0120,A SACRIFICE IS OF THIS TREASURE MADE SUCH AS I SAY AND MADE BY ITS OWN ACT WHAT CAN BE RENDERED THEN AS COMPENSATION THINK'ST THOU TO MAKE GOOD USE OF WHAT THOU'ST OFFERED,14.995
85-121551-0121,WITH GAINS ILL GOTTEN THOU WOULDST DO GOOD DEED NOW ART THOU CERTAIN OF THE GREATER POINT BUT BECAUSE HOLY CHURCH IN THIS DISPENSES WHICH SEEMS AGAINST THE TRUTH WHICH I HAVE SHOWN THEE,13.435
85-121551-0122,BECAUSE THE SOLID FOOD WHICH THOU HAST TAKEN REQUIRETH FURTHER AID FOR THY DIGESTION OPEN THY MIND TO THAT WHICH I REVEAL AND FIX IT THERE WITHIN FOR TIS NOT KNOWLEDGE,14.89
85-121551-0123,THE HAVING HEARD WITHOUT RETAINING IT IN THE ESSENCE OF THIS SACRIFICE TWO THINGS CONVENE TOGETHER AND THE ONE IS THAT OF WHICH TIS MADE THE OTHER IS THE AGREEMENT THIS LAST FOR EVERMORE IS CANCELLED NOT,16.045
85-121551-0124,UNLESS COMPLIED WITH AND CONCERNING THIS WITH SUCH PRECISION HAS ABOVE BEEN SPOKEN THEREFORE IT WAS ENJOINED UPON THE HEBREWS TO OFFER STILL THOUGH SOMETIMES WHAT WAS OFFERED MIGHT BE COMMUTED AS THOU OUGHT'ST TO KNOW THE OTHER,14.595
85-121551-0125,WHICH IS KNOWN TO THEE AS MATTER MAY WELL INDEED BE SUCH THAT ONE ERRS NOT,5.195
85-121551-0126,AT HIS ARBITRAMENT WITHOUT THE TURNING BOTH OF THE WHITE AND OF THE YELLOW KEY AND EVERY PERMUTATION DEEM AS FOOLISH IF IN THE SUBSTITUTE THE THING RELINQUISHED AS THE FOUR IS IN SIX BE NOT CONTAINED,15.105
85-121551-0127,THEREFORE WHATEVER THING HAS SO GREAT WEIGHT IN VALUE THAT IT DRAGS DOWN EVERY BALANCE CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH OTHER SPENDING LET MORTALS NEVER TAKE A VOW IN JEST,13.99
85-121551-0128,BE FAITHFUL AND NOT BLIND IN DOING THAT AS JEPHTHAH WAS IN HIS FIRST OFFERING WHOM MORE BESEEMED TO SAY I HAVE DONE WRONG THAN TO DO WORSE BY KEEPING,12.195

85-121551-0132,SILENCE IMPOSED UPON MY EAGER MIND THAT HAD ALREADY IN ADVANCE NEW QUESTIONS AND AS AN ARROW THAT UPON THE MARK STRIKES ERE THE BOWSTRING QUIET HATH BECOME SO DID WE SPEED INTO THE SECOND REALM,13.87
85-121551-0133,MY LADY THERE SO JOYFUL I BEHELD AS INTO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT HEAVEN SHE ENTERED MORE LUMINOUS THEREAT THE PLANET GREW AND IF THE STAR ITSELF WAS CHANGED AND SMILED,13.27

85-121551-0135,FULL OF BEATITUDE THE SHADE WAS SEEN BY THE EFFULGENCE CLEAR THAT ISSUED FROM IT THINK READER IF WHAT HERE IS JUST BEGINNING NO FARTHER SHOULD PROCEED,12.72
85-121551-0136,THOU'LT SEE HOW I FROM THESE WAS IN DESIRE OF HEARING THEIR CONDITIONS AS THEY UNTO MINE EYES WERE MANIFEST O THOU WELL BORN UNTO WHOM GRACE CONCEDES TO SEE THE THRONES OF THE ETERNAL TRIUMPH,15.1

85-121551-0140,EVEN AS THE SUN THAT DOTH CONCEAL HIMSELF BY TOO MUCH LIGHT,3.675
91-123498-0000,IN SUBMITTING CAPTAIN CARTER'S STRANGE MANUSCRIPT TO YOU IN BOOK FORM I BELIEVE THAT A FEW WORDS RELATIVE TO THIS REMARKABLE PERSONALITY WILL BE OF INTEREST MY FIRST RECOLLECTION OF CAPTAIN CARTER IS OF THE FEW MONTHS,15.205
91-123498-0001,HE SPENT AT MY FATHER'S HOME IN VIRGINIA JUST PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE CIVIL WAR I WAS THEN A CHILD OF BUT FIVE YEARS,9.085
91-123498-0002,DARK SMOOTH FACED ATHLETIC MAN WHOM I CALLED UNCLE JACK HE SEEMED ALWAYS TO BE LAUGHING,8.95
91-123498-0003,AND HE ENTERED INTO THE SPORTS OF THE CHILDREN WITH THE SAME HEARTY GOOD FELLOWSHIP HE DISPLAYED TOWARD THOSE PASTIMES IN WHICH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF HIS OWN AGE INDULGED,9.435
91-123498-0004,WILD LIFE IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD WE ALL LOVED HIM AND OUR SLAVES FAIRLY WORSHIPPED THE GROUND HE TROD HE WAS A SPLENDID SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD STANDING A GOOD TWO INCHES OVER SIX FEET BROAD OF SHOULDER AND NARROW OF HIP,16.415
91-123498-0005,WITH THE CARRIAGE OF THE TRAINED FIGHTING MAN HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND CLEAR CUT HIS HAIR BLACK AND CLOSELY CROPPED WHILE HIS EYES WERE OF A STEEL GRAY REFLECTING A STRONG AND LOYAL CHARACTER FILLED WITH FIRE,15.51
91-123498-0006,AND INITIATIVE HIS MANNERS WERE PERFECT AND HIS COURTLINESS WAS THAT OF A TYPICAL SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN OF THE HIGHEST TYPE HIS HORSEMANSHIP ESPECIALLY AFTER HOUNDS WAS A MARVEL AND DELIGHT,13.495
91-123498-0007,EVEN IN THAT COUNTRY OF MAGNIFICENT HORSEMEN I HAVE OFTEN HEARD MY FATHER CAUTION HIM AGAINST HIS WILD RECKLESSNESS BUT HE WOULD ONLY LAUGH AND SAY THAT THE TUMBLE THAT KILLED HIM WOULD BE FROM THE BACK OF A HORSE YET UNFOALED,16.04
91-123498-0008,WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT HE LEFT US NOR DID I SEE HIM AGAIN FOR SOME FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS WHEN HE RETURNED IT WAS WITHOUT WARNING AND I WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO NOTE THAT HE HAD NOT AGED APPARENTLY A MOMENT,12.26
91-123498-0009,THE SAME GENIAL HAPPY FELLOW WE HAD KNOWN OF OLD BUT WHEN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF ALONE I HAVE SEEN HIM SIT FOR HOURS GAZING OFF INTO SPACE HIS FACE SET IN A LOOK OF WISTFUL LONGING AND HOPELESS MISERY AND AT NIGHT HE WOULD SIT THUS,15.755
91-123498-0010,LOOKING UP INTO THE HEAVENS AT WHAT I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I READ HIS MANUSCRIPT YEARS AFTERWARD HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD BEEN PROSPECTING AND MINING IN ARIZONA PART OF THE TIME SINCE THE WAR,12.575
91-123498-0011,AND THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WAS EVIDENCED BY THE UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH WHICH HE WAS SUPPLIED,7.15
91-123498-0012,IN FACT HE WOULD NOT TALK OF THEM AT ALL HE REMAINED WITH US FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND THEN WENT TO NEW YORK WHERE HE PURCHASED A LITTLE PLACE ON THE HUDSON WHERE I VISITED HIM ONCE A YEAR ON THE OCCASIONS OF MY TRIPS TO THE NEW YORK MARKET,14.935
91-123498-0013,MY FATHER AND I OWNING AND OPERATING A STRING OF GENERAL STORES THROUGHOUT VIRGINIA AT THAT TIME CAPTAIN CARTER HAD A SMALL BUT BEAUTIFUL COTTAGE SITUATED ON A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE RIVER AND DURING ONE OF MY LAST VISITS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE,16.175
91-123498-0014,I OBSERVED HE WAS MUCH OCCUPIED IN WRITING I PRESUME NOW UPON THIS MANUSCRIPT HE TOLD ME AT THIS TIME THAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HIM HE WISHED ME TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS ESTATE,14.095
91-123498-0015,TELLING ME I WOULD FIND HIS WILL THERE AND SOME PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS WHICH HE HAD ME PLEDGE MYSELF TO CARRY OUT WITH ABSOLUTE FIDELITY AFTER I HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT,12.2
91-123498-0016,I HAVE SEEN HIM FROM MY WINDOW STANDING IN THE MOONLIGHT ON THE BRINK OF THE BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT TO THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IN APPEAL I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS PRAYING,11.57
91-123498-0017,ALTHOUGH I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM A RELIGIOUS MAN SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER I HAD RETURNED HOME FROM MY LAST VISIT,9.58
91-123498-0018,I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIM ASKING ME TO COME TO HIM AT ONCE I HAD,5.245
91-123498-0019,AND SO I HASTENED TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND I ARRIVED AT THE LITTLE STATION ABOUT A MILE FROM HIS GROUNDS ON THE MORNING OF MARCH FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX,10.485
91-123498-0020,IF I WAS A FRIEND OF THE CAPTAIN'S HE HAD SOME VERY BAD NEWS FOR ME THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD SHORTLY AFTER DAYLIGHT THAT VERY MORNING BY THE WATCHMAN ATTACHED TO AN ADJOINING PROPERTY FOR SOME REASON THIS NEWS DID NOT SURPRISE ME BUT,15.35
91-123498-0021,I HURRIED OUT TO HIS PLACE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT I COULD TAKE CHARGE OF THE BODY AND OF HIS AFFAIRS I FOUND THE WATCHMAN WHO HAD DISCOVERED HIM TOGETHER WITH THE LOCAL POLICE CHIEF AND SEVERAL TOWNSPEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN HIS LITTLE STUDY,15.06
91-123498-0022,THE WATCHMAN RELATED THE FEW DETAILS CONNECTED WITH THE FINDING OF THE BODY,3.88
91-123498-0023,WHEN HE CAME UPON IT IT LAY HE SAID STRETCHED FULL LENGTH IN THE SNOW WITH THE ARMS OUTSTRETCHED ABOVE THE HEAD TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF AND WHEN HE SHOWED ME THE SPOT IT FLASHED UPON ME THAT IT WAS THE IDENTICAL ONE,14.225
91-123498-0024,WHERE I HAD SEEN HIM ON THOSE OTHER NIGHTS WITH HIS ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION TO THE SKIES THERE WERE NO MARKS OF VIOLENCE ON THE BODY AND WITH THE AID OF A LOCAL PHYSICIAN THE CORONER'S JURY QUICKLY REACHED A DECISION OF DEATH FROM HEART FAILURE,14.735
91-123498-0025,LEFT ALONE IN THE STUDY I OPENED THE SAFE AND WITHDREW THE CONTENTS OF THE DRAWER IN WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME I WOULD FIND MY INSTRUCTIONS THEY WERE IN PART PECULIAR INDEED,11.56
91-123498-0026,BUT I HAVE FOLLOWED THEM TO EACH LAST DETAIL AS FAITHFULLY AS I WAS ABLE HE DIRECTED THAT I REMOVE HIS BODY TO VIRGINIA WITHOUT EMBALMING AND THAT HE BE LAID IN AN OPEN COFFIN WITHIN A TOMB,13.35
91-123498-0027,WHICH HE PREVIOUSLY HAD HAD CONSTRUCTED AND WHICH AS I LATER LEARNED,4.085
91-123498-0028,EVEN IN SECRECY IF NECESSARY HIS PROPERTY WAS LEFT IN SUCH A WAY THAT I WAS TO RECEIVE THE ENTIRE INCOME FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHEN THE PRINCIPAL WAS TO BECOME MINE,11.46
91-123498-0029,HIS FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO THIS MANUSCRIPT WHICH I WAS TO RETAIN SEALED AND UNREAD JUST AS I FOUND IT FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOR WAS I TO DIVULGE ITS CONTENTS UNTIL TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH,14.63
91-123498-0030,A STRANGE FEATURE ABOUT THE TOMB WHERE HIS BODY STILL LIES IS THAT THE MASSIVE DOOR IS EQUIPPED WITH A SINGLE HUGE GOLD PLATED SPRING LOCK WHICH CAN BE OPENED ONLY FROM THE INSIDE,12.725
91-123511-0000,LOVE MAKING ON MARS FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR SHIPS THE COMMUNITY REMAINED WITHIN THE CITY FOR SEVERAL DAYS ABANDONING THE HOMEWARD MARCH UNTIL THEY COULD FEEL REASONABLY ASSURED THAT THE SHIPS WOULD NOT RETURN,15.025
91-123511-0001,FOR TO BE CAUGHT ON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN WAS FAR FROM THE DESIRE OF EVEN SO WARLIKE A PEOPLE AS THE GREEN MARTIANS DURING OUR PERIOD OF INACTIVITY,13.195
91-123511-0002,TARS TARKAS HAD INSTRUCTED ME IN MANY OF THE CUSTOMS AND ARTS OF WAR FAMILIAR TO THE THARKS INCLUDING LESSONS IN RIDING AND GUIDING THE GREAT BEASTS WHICH BORE THE WARRIORS THESE CREATURES WHICH ARE KNOWN AS THOATS ARE AS DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS AS THEIR MASTERS BUT WHEN ONCE SUBDUED,16.25
91-123511-0003,TWO OF THESE ANIMALS HAD FALLEN TO ME FROM THE WARRIORS WHOSE METAL I WORE AND IN A SHORT TIME I COULD HANDLE THEM QUITE AS WELL AS THE NATIVE WARRIORS THE METHOD WAS NOT AT ALL COMPLICATED,10.825
91-123511-0004,THEY WERE DEALT A TERRIFIC BLOW BETWEEN THE EARS WITH THE BUTT OF A PISTOL AND IF THEY SHOWED FIGHT THIS TREATMENT WAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE BRUTES EITHER WERE SUBDUED OR HAD UNSEATED THEIR RIDERS,11.345
91-123511-0005,THOUGH UPON SOME OTHER BEAST IF NOT HIS TORN AND MANGLED BODY WAS GATHERED UP BY HIS WOMEN AND BURNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THARKIAN CUSTOM,9.115
91-123511-0006,MY EXPERIENCE WITH WOOLA DETERMINED ME TO ATTEMPT THE EXPERIMENT OF KINDNESS IN MY TREATMENT OF MY THOATS FIRST I TAUGHT THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT UNSEAT ME AND EVEN RAPPED THEM SHARPLY BETWEEN THE EARS TO IMPRESS UPON THEM MY AUTHORITY AND MASTERY,14.8599375
91-123511-0007,I WAS EVER A GOOD HAND WITH ANIMALS AND BY INCLINATION AS WELL AS BECAUSE IT BROUGHT MORE LASTING AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS I WAS ALWAYS KIND AND HUMANE IN MY DEALINGS WITH THE LOWER ORDERS,11.65
91-123511-0008,I COULD TAKE A HUMAN LIFE IF NECESSARY WITH FAR LESS COMPUNCTION THAN THAT OF A POOR,5.38
91-123511-0009,THEY WOULD FOLLOW ME LIKE DOGS RUBBING THEIR GREAT SNOUTS AGAINST MY BODY IN AWKWARD EVIDENCE OF AFFECTION AND RESPOND TO MY EVERY COMMAND WITH AN ALACRITY AND DOCILITY WHICH CAUSED THE MARTIAN WARRIORS TO ASCRIBE TO ME THE POSSESSION OF SOME EARTHLY POWER UNKNOWN ON MARS,16.37
91-123511-0010,ASKED TARS TARKAS ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD SEEN ME RUN MY ARM FAR BETWEEN THE GREAT JAWS OF ONE OF MY THOATS WHICH HAD WEDGED A PIECE OF STONE BETWEEN TWO OF HIS TEETH WHILE FEEDING UPON THE MOSS LIKE VEGETATION WITHIN OUR COURT YARD,14.255
91-123511-0011,BY KINDNESS I REPLIED YOU SEE TARS TARKAS THE SOFTER SENTIMENTS HAVE THEIR VALUE EVEN TO A WARRIOR IN THE HEIGHT OF BATTLE AS WELL AS UPON THE MARCH I KNOW THAT MY THOATS WILL OBEY MY EVERY COMMAND,13.655
91-123511-0012,AND THEREFORE MY FIGHTING EFFICIENCY IS ENHANCED AND I AM A BETTER WARRIOR FOR THE REASON THAT I AM A KIND MASTER YOUR OTHER WARRIORS WOULD FIND IT TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THEMSELVES AS WELL AS OF THE COMMUNITY TO ADOPT MY METHODS IN THIS RESPECT,14.275
91-123511-0013,ONLY A FEW DAYS SINCE YOU YOURSELF TOLD ME THAT THESE GREAT BRUTES BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR TEMPERS OFTEN WERE THE MEANS OF TURNING VICTORY INTO DEFEAT SINCE AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT THEY MIGHT ELECT TO UNSEAT AND REND THEIR RIDERS,13.48
91-123511-0014,SHOW ME HOW YOU ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS WAS TARS TARKAS ONLY REJOINDER AND SO I EXPLAINED AS CAREFULLY AS I COULD THE ENTIRE METHOD OF TRAINING I HAD ADOPTED WITH MY BEASTS AND LATER HE HAD ME REPEAT IT BEFORE LORQUAS PTOMEL AND THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS,15.68
91-123511-0015,THAT MOMENT MARKED THE BEGINNING OF A NEW EXISTENCE FOR THE POOR THOATS,4.1149375
91-123511-0016,I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF OBSERVING A REGIMENT OF AS TRACTABLE AND DOCILE MOUNTS AS ONE MIGHT CARE TO SEE THE EFFECT ON THE PRECISION AND CELERITY OF THE MILITARY MOVEMENTS WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT LORQUAS PTOMEL PRESENTED ME WITH A MASSIVE,14.12
91-123511-0017,ANKLET OF GOLD FROM HIS OWN LEG AS A SIGN OF HIS APPRECIATION OF MY SERVICE TO THE HORDE ON THE SEVENTH DAY FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR CRAFT WE AGAIN TOOK UP THE MARCH TOWARD THARK ALL PROBABILITY OF ANOTHER ATTACK BEING DEEMED REMOTE,16.04
91-123511-0018,DURING THE DAYS JUST PRECEDING OUR DEPARTURE I HAD SEEN BUT LITTLE OF DEJAH THORIS,4.7
91-123511-0019,AS WELL AS IN THE TRAINING OF MY THOATS THE FEW TIMES I HAD VISITED HER QUARTERS SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT WALKING UPON THE STREETS WITH SOLA OR INVESTIGATING THE BUILDINGS IN THE NEAR VICINITY OF THE PLAZA,12.75
91-123511-0020,I HAD WARNED THEM AGAINST VENTURING FAR FROM THE PLAZA FOR FEAR OF THE GREAT WHITE APES WHOSE FEROCITY I WAS ONLY TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HOWEVER SINCE WOOLA ACCOMPANIED THEM ON ALL THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS SOLA WAS WELL ARMED,15.105
91-123511-0021,THERE WAS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE CAUSE FOR FEAR ON THE EVENING BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE I SAW THEM APPROACHING ALONG ONE OF THE GREAT AVENUES WHICH LEAD INTO THE PLAZA FROM THE EAST,11.705
91-123511-0022,I ADVANCED TO MEET THEM AND TELLING SOLA THAT I WOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEJAH THORIS SAFEKEEPING I DIRECTED HER TO RETURN TO HER QUARTERS ON SOME TRIVIAL ERRAND I LIKED AND TRUSTED SOLA BUT FOR SOME REASON I DESIRED TO BE ALONE WITH DEJAH THORIS,15.675
91-123511-0023,WHO REPRESENTED TO ME ALL THAT I HAD LEFT BEHIND UPON EARTH IN AGREEABLE AND CONGENIAL COMPANIONSHIP THERE SEEMED BONDS OF MUTUAL INTEREST BETWEEN US AS POWERFUL AS,11.575
91-123511-0024,THAT SHE SHARED MY SENTIMENTS IN THIS RESPECT I WAS POSITIVE FOR ON MY APPROACH THE LOOK OF PITIFUL HOPELESSNESS LEFT HER SWEET COUNTENANCE TO BE REPLACED BY A SMILE OF JOYFUL WELCOME,11.18
91-123511-0025,AS SHE PLACED HER LITTLE RIGHT HAND UPON MY LEFT SHOULDER IN TRUE RED MARTIAN SALUTE SARKOJA TOLD SOLA THAT YOU HAD BECOME A TRUE THARK SHE SAID,9.095
91-123511-0026,NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROUD CLAIM OF THE THARKS TO ABSOLUTE VERITY DEJAH THORIS LAUGHED I KNEW THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU BECAME A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY YOU WOULD NOT CEASE TO BE MY FRIEND A WARRIOR MAY CHANGE HIS METAL BUT NOT HIS HEART AS THE SAYING IS UPON BARSOOM,16.91
91-123511-0027,I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP US APART SHE CONTINUED FOR WHENEVER YOU HAVE BEEN OFF DUTY ONE OF THE OLDER WOMEN OF TARS TARKAS RETINUE HAS ALWAYS ARRANGED TO TRUMP UP SOME EXCUSE TO GET SOLA AND ME OUT OF SIGHT,12.76
91-123511-0028,THEY HAVE HAD ME DOWN IN THE PITS BELOW THE BUILDINGS HELPING THEM MIX THEIR AWFUL RADIUM POWDER AND MAKE THEIR TERRIBLE PROJECTILES YOU KNOW THAT THESE HAVE TO BE MANUFACTURED BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT,10.45
91-123511-0029,THEIR BULLETS EXPLODE WHEN THEY STRIKE AN OBJECT WELL THE OPAQUE OUTER COATING IS BROKEN BY THE IMPACT EXPOSING A GLASS CYLINDER ALMOST SOLID IN THE FORWARD END OF WHICH IS A MINUTE PARTICLE OF RADIUM POWDER,12.175
91-123511-0030,THE MOMENT THE SUNLIGHT EVEN THOUGH DIFFUSED STRIKES THIS POWDER IT EXPLODES WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH NOTHING CAN WITHSTAND IF YOU EVER WITNESS A NIGHT BATTLE YOU WILL NOTE THE ABSENCE OF THESE EXPLOSIONS,11.18
91-123511-0031,I ASKED FEELING THE HOT BLOOD OF MY FIGHTING ANCESTORS LEAP IN MY VEINS AS I AWAITED HER REPLY ONLY IN LITTLE WAYS JOHN CARTER SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THAT CAN HARM ME OUTSIDE MY PRIDE,12.645
91-123511-0032,THEY KNOW THAT I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TEN THOUSAND JEDDAKS THAT I TRACE MY ANCESTRY STRAIGHT BACK WITHOUT A BREAK TO THE BUILDER OF THE FIRST GREAT WATERWAY,8.475
91-123511-0033,AT HEART THEY HATE THEIR HORRID FATES AND SO WREAK THEIR POOR SPITE ON ME WHO STAND FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE NOT AND FOR ALL THEY MOST CRAVE AND NEVER CAN ATTAIN LET US PITY THEM MY CHIEFTAIN,12.49
91-123511-0034,FOR EVEN THOUGH WE DIE AT THEIR HANDS WE CAN AFFORD THEM PITY SINCE WE ARE GREATER THAN THEY AND THEY KNOW IT,6.175
91-123511-0035,I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SURPRISE OF MY LIFE BUT I DID NOT KNOW AT THAT TIME NOR FOR MANY MONTHS THEREAFTER YES I STILL HAD MUCH TO LEARN UPON BARSOOM I PRESUME IT IS THE BETTER PART OF WISDOM THAT WE BOW TO OUR FATE WITH AS GOOD GRACE AS POSSIBLE DEJAH THORIS,16.665
91-123511-0036,BUT I HOPE NEVERTHELESS THAT I MAY BE PRESENT THE NEXT TIME THAT ANY MARTIAN GREEN RED PINK OR VIOLET HAS THE TEMERITY TO EVEN SO MUCH AS FROWN ON YOU MY PRINCESS,10.73
91-123511-0037,AND GAZED UPON ME WITH DILATED EYES AND QUICKENING BREATH,3.54
91-123511-0038,WHICH BROUGHT ROGUISH DIMPLES TO THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND CRIED WHAT A CHILD A GREAT WARRIOR AND YET A STUMBLING LITTLE CHILD WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW I ASKED IN SORE PERPLEXITY,15.07
91-123511-0039,SOME DAY YOU SHALL KNOW JOHN CARTER IF WE LIVE BUT I MAY NOT TELL YOU AND I,5.695
91-123511-0040,SHE SOLILOQUIZED IN CONCLUSION THEN SHE BROKE OUT AGAIN INTO ONE OF HER GAY HAPPY LAUGHING MOODS JOKING WITH ME ON MY PROWESS AS A THARK WARRIOR AS CONTRASTED WITH MY SOFT HEART AND NATURAL KINDLINESS I PRESUME,15.83
91-123511-0041,THAT SHOULD YOU ACCIDENTALLY WOUND AN ENEMY YOU WOULD TAKE HIM HOME AND NURSE HIM BACK TO HEALTH SHE LAUGHED THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE DO ON EARTH I ANSWERED AT LEAST AMONG CIVILIZED MEN THIS MADE HER LAUGH AGAIN,13.895
91-123511-0042,SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT FOR WITH ALL HER TENDERNESS AND WOMANLY SWEETNESS SHE WAS STILL A MARTIAN AND TO A MARTIAN THE ONLY GOOD ENEMY IS A DEAD ENEMY FOR EVERY DEAD FOEMAN MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO LIVE,15.105
91-123511-0043,A MOMENT BEFORE AND SO I CONTINUED TO IMPORTUNE HER TO ENLIGHTEN ME NO SHE EXCLAIMED IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE SAID IT AND THAT I HAVE LISTENED AND WHEN YOU LEARN JOHN CARTER AND IF I BE DEAD,13.565
91-123511-0044,AND THAT I SMILED IT WAS ALL GREEK TO ME BUT THE MORE I BEGGED HER TO EXPLAIN THE MORE POSITIVE BECAME HER DENIALS OF MY REQUEST AND SO IN VERY HOPELESSNESS I DESISTED,13.43
91-123511-0045,DAY HAD NOW GIVEN AWAY TO NIGHT AND AS WE WANDERED ALONG THE GREAT AVENUE LIGHTED BY THE TWO MOONS OF BARSOOM AND WITH EARTH LOOKING DOWN UPON US OUT OF HER LUMINOUS GREEN EYE IT SEEMED THAT WE WERE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE AND I AT LEAST,14.655
91-123511-0046,WAS CONTENT THAT IT SHOULD BE SO THE CHILL OF THE MARTIAN NIGHT WAS UPON US AND REMOVING MY SILKS I THREW THEM ACROSS THE SHOULDERS OF DEJAH THORIS AS MY ARM RESTED FOR AN INSTANT UPON HER I FELT A THRILL PASS THROUGH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING,16.005
91-123511-0047,SUCH AS CONTACT WITH NO OTHER MORTAL HAD EVEN PRODUCED AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE HAD LEANED SLIGHTLY TOWARD ME BUT OF THAT I WAS NOT SURE ONLY I KNEW THAT AS MY ARM RESTED THERE ACROSS HER SHOULDERS,14.015
91-123511-0048,LONGER THAN THE ACT OF ADJUSTING THE SILK REQUIRED SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY NOR DID SHE SPEAK AND SO IN SILENCE WE WALKED THE SURFACE OF A DYING WORLD BUT IN THE BREAST OF ONE OF US AT LEAST HAD BEEN BORN THAT,14.98
91-123511-0049,WHICH IS EVER OLDEST YET EVER NEW I LOVED DEJAH THORIS THE TOUCH OF MY ARM UPON HER NAKED SHOULDER HAD SPOKEN TO ME IN WORDS I WOULD NOT MISTAKE,11.155
91-123521-0000,LOST IN THE SKY WITHOUT EFFORT AT CONCEALMENT I HASTENED TO THE VICINITY OF OUR QUARTERS,7.98
91-123521-0001,AS I NEARED THE BUILDING I BECAME MORE CAREFUL AS I JUDGED AND RIGHTLY THAT THE PLACE WOULD BE GUARDED SEVERAL MEN IN CIVILIAN METAL LOITERED NEAR THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND IN THE REAR WERE OTHERS MY ONLY MEANS OF REACHING,15.185
91-123521-0002,UNSEEN THE UPPER STORY WHERE OUR APARTMENTS WERE SITUATED WAS THROUGH AN ADJOINING BUILDING AND AFTER CONSIDERABLE MANEUVERING I MANAGED TO ATTAIN THE ROOF OF A SHOP SEVERAL DOORS AWAY LEAPING FROM ROOF TO ROOF,13.59
91-123521-0003,I SOON REACHED AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE BUILDING WHERE I HOPED TO FIND THE HELIUMITE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I STOOD IN THE ROOM BEFORE HIM HE WAS ALONE AND SHOWED NO SURPRISE AT MY COMING SAYING HE HAD EXPECTED ME MUCH EARLIER,13.935
91-123521-0004,AS MY TOUR OF DUTY MUST HAVE ENDED SOME TIME SINCE I SAW THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AT THE PALACE AND WHEN I HAD ENLIGHTENED HIM HE WAS ALL EXCITEMENT THE NEWS THAT DEJAH THORIS HAD PROMISED HER HAND TO SAB THAN,15.705
91-123521-0005,FILLED HIM WITH DISMAY IT CANNOT BE HE EXCLAIMED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHY NO MAN IN ALL HELIUM BUT WOULD PREFER DEATH TO THE SELLING OF OUR LOVED PRINCESS TO THE RULING HOUSE OF ZODANGA,15.285
91-123521-0006,SHE MUST HAVE LOST HER MIND TO HAVE ASSENTED TO SUCH AN ATROCIOUS BARGAIN YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW WE OF HELIUM LOVE THE MEMBERS OF OUR RULING HOUSE CANNOT APPRECIATE THE HORROR WITH WHICH I CONTEMPLATE SUCH AN UNHOLY ALLIANCE,16.39
91-123521-0007,WHAT CAN BE DONE JOHN CARTER HE CONTINUED YOU ARE A RESOURCEFUL MAN CAN YOU NOT THINK OF SOME WAY TO SAVE HELIUM FROM THIS DISGRACE IF I CAN COME WITHIN SWORD'S REACH OF SAB THAN I ANSWERED,13.685
91-123521-0008,I CAN SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY IN SO FAR AS HELIUM IS CONCERNED BUT FOR PERSONAL REASONS I WOULD PREFER THAT ANOTHER STRUCK THE BLOW THAT FREES DEJAH THORIS KANTOS KAN EYED ME NARROWLY BEFORE HE SPOKE,13.77
91-123521-0009,SHE KNOWS IT KANTOS KAN AND REPULSES ME ONLY BECAUSE SHE IS PROMISED TO SAB THAN THE SPLENDID FELLOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET,10.32
91-123521-0010,AND HAD THE CHOICE BEEN LEFT TO ME I COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A MORE FITTING MATE FOR THE FIRST PRINCESS OF BARSOOM HERE IS MY HAND UPON YOUR SHOULDER JOHN CARTER AND MY WORD,11.87
91-123521-0011,FOR DEJAH THORIS AND FOR YOU THIS VERY NIGHT I SHALL TRY TO REACH HIS QUARTERS IN THE PALACE HOW I ASKED YOU ARE STRONGLY GUARDED AND A QUADRUPLE FORCE PATROLS THE SKY HE BENT HIS HEAD IN THOUGHT,15.175
91-123521-0012,A MOMENT THEN RAISED IT WITH AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE I ONLY NEED TO PASS THESE GUARDS AND I CAN DO IT HE SAID AT LAST,6.835
91-123521-0013,I FELL UPON IT BY CHANCE ONE DAY AS I WAS PASSING ABOVE THE PALACE ON PATROL DUTY IN THIS WORK IT IS REQUIRED THAT WE INVESTIGATE ANY UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE WE MAY WITNESS AND A FACE PEERING FROM THE PINNACLE OF THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE WAS TO ME MOST,16.135
91-123521-0014,UNUSUAL I THEREFORE DREW NEAR AND DISCOVERED THAT THE POSSESSOR OF THE PEERING FACE WAS NONE OTHER THAN SAB THAN HE WAS SLIGHTLY PUT OUT AT BEING DETECTED AND COMMANDED ME TO KEEP THE MATTER TO MYSELF EXPLAINING THAT THE PASSAGE FROM THE TOWER,15.655
91-123521-0015,LED DIRECTLY TO HIS APARTMENTS AND WAS KNOWN ONLY TO HIM IF I CAN REACH THE ROOF OF THE BARRACKS AND GET MY MACHINE I CAN BE IN SAB THAN'S QUARTERS IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HOW AM I TO ESCAPE FROM THIS BUILDING GUARDED AS YOU SAY IT IS,15.94
91-123521-0016,I ASKED THERE IS USUALLY BUT ONE MAN ON DUTY THERE AT NIGHT UPON THE ROOF GO TO THE ROOF OF THIS BUILDING KANTOS KAN AND WAIT ME THERE,10.46
91-123521-0017,THE BUILDING WAS AN ENORMOUS ONE REARING ITS LOFTY HEAD FULLY A THOUSAND FEET INTO THE AIR BUT FEW BUILDINGS IN ZODANGA WERE HIGHER THAN THESE BARRACKS THOUGH SEVERAL TOPPED IT BY A FEW HUNDRED FEET,12.685
91-123521-0018,THE DOCKS OF THE GREAT BATTLESHIPS OF THE LINE STANDING SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET FROM THE GROUND WHILE THE FREIGHT AND PASSENGER STATIONS OF THE MERCHANT SQUADRONS ROSE NEARLY AS HIGH IT WAS A LONG CLIMB UP THE FACE OF THE BUILDING AND ONE FRAUGHT WITH MUCH DANGER BUT,15.135
91-123521-0019,THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AND SO I ESSAYED THE TASK THE FACT THAT BARSOOMIAN ARCHITECTURE IS EXTREMELY ORNATE MADE THE FEAT MUCH SIMPLER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED SINCE I FOUND ORNAMENTAL LEDGES AND PROJECTIONS,13.285
91-123521-0020,WHICH FAIRLY FORMED A PERFECT LADDER FOR ME ALL THE WAY TO THE EAVES OF THE BUILDING HERE I MET MY FIRST REAL OBSTACLE THE EAVES PROJECTED NEARLY TWENTY FEET FROM THE WALL TO WHICH I CLUNG AND THOUGH I ENCIRCLED THE GREAT BUILDING I COULD FIND NO OPENING THROUGH THEM,15.585
91-123521-0021,THE TOP FLOOR WAS ALIGHT AND FILLED WITH SOLDIERS ENGAGED IN THE PASTIMES OF THEIR KIND,5.505
91-123521-0022,THERE WAS ONE SLIGHT DESPERATE CHANCE AND THAT I DECIDED I MUST TAKE IT WAS FOR DEJAH THORIS AND NO MAN HAS LIVED WHO WOULD NOT RISK A THOUSAND DEATHS FOR SUCH AS SHE CLINGING TO THE WALL WITH MY FEET,14.645
91-123521-0023,AND ONE HAND I UNLOOSENED ONE OF THE LONG LEATHER STRAPS OF MY TRAPPINGS AT THE END OF WHICH DANGLED A GREAT HOOK BY WHICH AIR SAILORS ARE HUNG TO THE SIDES AND BOTTOMS OF THEIR CRAFT FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES OF REPAIR,12.1
91-123521-0024,AND BY MEANS OF WHICH LANDING PARTIES ARE LOWERED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BATTLESHIPS I SWUNG THIS HOOK CAUTIOUSLY,7.18
91-123521-0025,GENTLY I PULLED ON IT TO STRENGTHEN ITS HOLD BUT WHETHER IT WOULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY I DID NOT KNOW IT MIGHT BE BARELY CAUGHT UPON THE VERY OUTER VERGE OF THE ROOF,10.495
91-123521-0026,SO THAT AS MY BODY SWUNG OUT AT THE END OF THE STRAP IT WOULD SLIP OFF AND LAUNCH ME TO THE PAVEMENT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW AN INSTANT I HESITATED AND THEN RELEASING MY GRASP UPON THE SUPPORTING ORNAMENT I SWUNG OUT INTO SPACE AT THE END OF THE STRAP,15.93
91-123521-0027,FAR BELOW ME LAY THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED STREETS THE HARD PAVEMENTS AND DEATH THERE WAS A LITTLE JERK AT THE TOP OF THE SUPPORTING EAVES,8.845
91-123521-0028,GRATING SOUND WHICH TURNED ME COLD WITH APPREHENSION THEN THE HOOK CAUGHT AND I WAS SAFE CLAMBERING QUICKLY ALOFT I GRASPED THE EDGE OF THE EAVES AND DREW MYSELF TO THE SURFACE OF THE ROOF ABOVE,13.29
91-123521-0029,AS I GAINED MY FEET I WAS CONFRONTED BY THE SENTRY ON DUTY INTO THE MUZZLE OF WHOSE REVOLVER I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING WHO ARE YOU AND WHENCE CAME YOU HE CRIED,11.26
91-123521-0030,I AM AN AIR SCOUT FRIEND AND VERY NEAR A DEAD ONE FOR JUST BY THE MEREST CHANCE I ESCAPED FALLING TO THE AVENUE BELOW I REPLIED BUT HOW CAME YOU UPON THE ROOF MAN NO ONE HAS LANDED OR COME UP FROM THE BUILDING FOR THE PAST HOUR,14.865
91-123521-0031,QUICK EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR I CALL THE GUARD LOOK YOU HERE SENTRY AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW I CAME,7.81
91-123521-0032,I ANSWERED TURNING TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE ROOF WHERE TWENTY FEET BELOW AT THE END OF MY STRAP HUNG ALL MY WEAPONS THE FELLOW ACTING ON IMPULSE OF CURIOSITY STEPPED TO MY SIDE AND TO HIS UNDOING,13.405
91-123521-0033,FOR AS HE LEANED TO PEER OVER THE EAVES I GRASPED HIM BY HIS THROAT AND HIS PISTOL ARM AND THREW HIM HEAVILY TO THE ROOF THE WEAPON DROPPED FROM HIS GRASP AND MY FINGERS CHOKED OFF HIS ATTEMPTED CRY FOR ASSISTANCE I GAGGED AND BOUND HIM,14.38
91-123521-0034,AND THEN HUNG HIM OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF AS I MYSELF HAD HUNG A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE I KNEW IT WOULD BE MORNING BEFORE HE WOULD BE DISCOVERED AND I NEEDED ALL THE TIME THAT I COULD GAIN DONNING MY TRAPPINGS AND WEAPONS,14.895
91-123521-0035,I HASTENED TO THE SHEDS AND SOON HAD OUT BOTH MY MACHINE AND KANTOS KAN'S,5.015
91-123521-0036,I DOVE DOWN INTO THE STREETS OF THE CITY FAR BELOW THE PLANE USUALLY OCCUPIED BY THE AIR PATROL IN LESS THAN A MINUTE I WAS SETTLING SAFELY UPON THE ROOF OF OUR APARTMENT BESIDE THE ASTONISHED KANTOS KAN,12.985
91-123521-0037,I LOST NO TIME IN EXPLANATION BUT PLUNGED IMMEDIATELY INTO A DISCUSSION OF OUR PLANS FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE,6.58
91-123521-0038,IF SUCCESSFUL HE WAS THEN TO FOLLOW ME HE SET MY COMPASS FOR ME A CLEVER LITTLE DEVICE WHICH WILL REMAIN STEADFASTLY FIXED UPON ANY GIVEN POINT ON THE SURFACE OF BARSOOM AND BIDDING EACH OTHER FAREWELL WE ROSE TOGETHER,14.375
91-123521-0039,AS WE NEARED THE HIGH TOWER A PATROL SHOT DOWN FROM ABOVE,4.145
91-123521-0040,AND A VOICE ROARED OUT A COMMAND TO HALT FOLLOWING WITH A SHOT AS I PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIS HAIL KANTOS KAN DROPPED QUICKLY INTO THE DARKNESS WHILE I ROSE STEADILY,10.025
91-123521-0041,AND LATER BY A SWIFT CRUISER CARRYING A HUNDRED MEN AND A BATTERY OF RAPID FIRE GUNS,5.75
91-123521-0042,I MANAGED TO ELUDE THEIR SEARCH LIGHTS MOST OF THE TIME BUT I WAS ALSO LOSING GROUND BY THESE TACTICS AND SO I DECIDED TO HAZARD EVERYTHING ON A STRAIGHT AWAY COURSE AND LEAVE THE RESULT TO FATE AND THE SPEED OF MY MACHINE,13.71
91-123521-0043,GRADUALLY I LEFT MY PURSUERS FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND AND I WAS JUST CONGRATULATING MYSELF ON MY LUCKY ESCAPE,7.115
91-123521-0044,THE CONCUSSION NEARLY CAPSIZED HER AND WITH A SICKENING PLUNGE SHE HURTLED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT,7.02
91-123521-0045,I MUST HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND WHEN I STARTED TO RISE AGAIN AS I PLAINLY HEARD THE SQUEALING OF ANIMALS BELOW ME RISING AGAIN I SCANNED THE HEAVENS FOR MY PURSUERS AND FINALLY MAKING OUT THEIR LIGHTS FAR BEHIND ME SAW THAT THEY WERE LANDING,14.585
91-123521-0046,EVIDENTLY IN SEARCH OF ME NOT UNTIL THEIR LIGHTS WERE NO LONGER DISCERNIBLE DID I VENTURE TO FLASH MY LITTLE LAMP UPON MY COMPASS,8.77
91-123521-0047,AND THEN I FOUND TO MY CONSTERNATION THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE PROJECTILE HAD UTTERLY DESTROYED MY ONLY GUIDE AS WELL AS MY SPEEDOMETER IT WAS TRUE I COULD FOLLOW THE STARS IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF HELIUM BUT WITHOUT KNOWING THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE CITY,15.16
91-123521-0048,OR THE SPEED AT WHICH I WAS TRAVELING MY CHANCES FOR FINDING IT WERE SLIM HELIUM LIES A THOUSAND MILES SOUTHWEST OF ZODANGA AND WITH MY COMPASS INTACT I SHOULD HAVE MADE THE TRIP,11.48
91-123521-0049,AS IT TURNED OUT HOWEVER MORNING FOUND ME SPEEDING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF DEAD SEA BOTTOM AFTER NEARLY SIX HOURS OF CONTINUOUS FLIGHT AT HIGH SPEED PRESENTLY A GREAT CITY SHOWED BELOW ME BUT IT WAS NOT HELIUM,13.845
91-123521-0050,AS THAT ALONE OF ALL BARSOOMIAN METROPOLISES CONSISTS IN TWO IMMENSE CIRCULAR WALLED CITIES,6.36
91-123521-0051,AND WEST I TURNED BACK IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION,3.26
91-123521-0052,BUT NONE RESEMBLING THE DESCRIPTION WHICH KANTOS KAN HAD GIVEN ME OF HELIUM,4.325
91-123526-0000,AT THE ARIZONA CAVE IT WAS DARK WHEN I OPENED MY EYES AGAIN STRANGE STIFF GARMENTS WERE UPON MY BODY,11.75
91-123526-0001,I FELT MYSELF OVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WAS CLOTHED,5.75
91-123526-0002,BEFORE ME WAS A SMALL PATCH OF MOONLIT SKY WHICH SHOWED THROUGH A RAGGED APERTURE AS MY HANDS PASSED OVER MY BODY THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH POCKETS AND IN ONE OF THESE A SMALL PARCEL OF MATCHES WRAPPED IN OILED PAPER,14.545
91-123526-0003,ONE OF THESE MATCHES I STRUCK AND ITS DIM FLAME LIGHTED UP WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HUGE CAVE TOWARD THE BACK OF WHICH I DISCOVERED A STRANGE STILL FIGURE HUDDLED OVER A TINY BENCH AS I APPROACHED IT,15.73
91-123526-0004,AND MUMMIFIED REMAINS OF A LITTLE OLD WOMAN WITH LONG BLACK HAIR AND THE THING IT LEANED OVER WAS A SMALL CHARCOAL BURNER UPON WHICH RESTED A ROUND COPPER VESSEL CONTAINING A SMALL QUANTITY OF GREENISH POWDER,13.75
91-123526-0005,BEHIND HER DEPENDING FROM THE ROOF UPON RAWHIDE THONGS AND STRETCHING ENTIRELY ACROSS THE CAVE WAS A ROW OF HUMAN SKELETONS FROM THE THONG WHICH HELD THEM STRETCHED ANOTHER TO THE DEAD HAND OF THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN,14.805
91-123526-0006,AS I TOUCHED THE CORD THE SKELETONS SWUNG TO THE MOTION WITH A NOISE AS OF THE RUSTLING OF DRY LEAVES IT WAS A MOST GROTESQUE AND HORRID TABLEAU AND I HASTENED OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM SO GRUESOME A PLACE,15.235
91-123526-0007,THE SIGHT THAT MET MY EYES AS I STEPPED OUT UPON A SMALL LEDGE WHICH RAN BEFORE THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE FILLED ME WITH CONSTERNATION A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW LANDSCAPE MET MY GAZE,13.2
91-123526-0008,THE SILVERED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE THE ALMOST STATIONARY MOON HANGING IN THE SKY THE CACTI STUDDED VALLEY BELOW ME WERE NOT OF MARS,9.17
91-123526-0009,BUT THE TRUTH SLOWLY FORCED ITSELF UPON ME I WAS LOOKING UPON ARIZONA FROM THE SAME LEDGE FROM WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE I HAD GAZED WITH LONGING UPON MARS BURYING MY HEAD IN MY ARMS I TURNED,13.985
91-123526-0010,DID THE VITALIZING AIR REACH THE PEOPLE OF THAT DISTANT PLANET IN TIME TO SAVE THEM,4.865
91-123526-0011,OR DID HER BEAUTIFUL BODY LIE COLD IN DEATH BESIDE THE TINY GOLDEN INCUBATOR IN THE SUNKEN GARDEN,7.025
91-123526-0012,THE JEDDAK OF HELIUM FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED FOR AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED TO BE TAKEN BACK TO THE WORLD OF MY LOST LOVE I WOULD RATHER LIE DEAD BESIDE HER THERE,15.125
91-123526-0013,THAN LIVE ON EARTH ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF TERRIBLE MILES FROM HER THE OLD MINE WHICH I FOUND UNTOUCHED HAS MADE ME FABULOUSLY WEALTHY BUT WHAT CARE I FOR WEALTH,12.605
91-123526-0014,AS I SIT HERE TONIGHT IN MY LITTLE STUDY OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON JUST TWENTY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE I FIRST OPENED MY EYES UPON MARS,8.88
91-123526-0015,AND TONIGHT SHE SEEMS CALLING TO ME AGAIN AS SHE HAS NOT CALLED BEFORE SINCE THAT LONG DEAD NIGHT AND I THINK I CAN SEE ACROSS THAT AWFUL ABYSS OF SPACE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIRED WOMAN STANDING IN THE GARDEN OF A PALACE AND AT HER SIDE IS A LITTLE BOY WHO PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER,16.71
92-204-0000,HALF A MINUTE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGH THE PUMP YARD TO THE ARCHWAY OPPOSITE UNION PASSAGE BUT HERE THEY WERE STOPPED EVERYBODY ACQUAINTED WITH BATH MAY REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CROSSING CHEAP STREET AT THIS POINT,14.33
92-204-0001,IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE SO UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS AND THE PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF LADIES HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS,15.08
92-204-0002,WHETHER IN QUEST OF PASTRY MILLINERY OR EVEN AS IN THE PRESENT CASE OF YOUNG MEN ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS,11.44
92-204-0003,AND SHE WAS NOW FATED TO FEEL AND LAMENT IT ONCE MORE FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT OF COMING OPPOSITE TO UNION PASSAGE,7.35
92-204-0004,AND THREADING THE GUTTERS OF THAT INTERESTING ALLEY,2.81
92-204-0005,DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENT BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM,16.875
92-204-0006,BUT THIS DETESTATION THOUGH SO JUST WAS OF SHORT DURATION FOR SHE LOOKED AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED DELIGHTFUL MISTER MORLAND AND MY BROTHER GOOD HEAVEN TIS JAMES WAS UTTERED AT THE SAME MOMENT BY CATHERINE,15.56
92-204-0007,THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES,4.78
92-204-0008,CATHERINE BY WHOM THIS MEETING WAS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED RECEIVED HER BROTHER WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND HE BEING OF A VERY AMIABLE DISPOSITION AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER GAVE EVERY PROOF ON HIS SIDE OF EQUAL SATISFACTION,13.99
92-204-0009,WHICH HE COULD HAVE LEISURE TO DO WHILE THE BRIGHT EYES OF MISS THORPE WERE INCESSANTLY CHALLENGING HIS NOTICE AND TO HER HIS DEVOIRS WERE SPEEDILY PAID WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFORMED CATHERINE,13.085
92-204-0010,AND LESS SIMPLY ENGROSSED BY HER OWN THAT HER BROTHER THOUGHT HER FRIEND QUITE AS PRETTY AS SHE COULD DO HERSELF JOHN THORPE WHO IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN GIVING ORDERS ABOUT THE HORSES SOON JOINED THEM AND FROM HIM SHE DIRECTLY RECEIVED THE AMENDS WHICH WERE HER DUE,16.565
92-204-0011,FOR WHILE HE SLIGHTLY AND CARELESSLY TOUCHED THE HAND OF ISABELLA ON HER HE BESTOWED A WHOLE SCRAPE AND HALF A SHORT BOW HE WAS A STOUT YOUNG MAN OF MIDDLING HEIGHT WHO WITH A PLAIN FACE AND UNGRACEFUL FORM,13.685
92-204-0012,AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE WERE EASY WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE EASY HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IT FROM TETBURY MISS MORLAND I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE,15.53
92-204-0013,HER BROTHER TOLD HER THAT IT WAS TWENTY THREE MILES THREE AND TWENTY CRIED THORPE FIVE AND TWENTY IF IT IS AN INCH MORLAND REMONSTRATED PLEADED THE AUTHORITY OF ROAD BOOKS INNKEEPERS AND MILESTONES,14.09
92-204-0014,BUT HIS FRIEND DISREGARDED THEM ALL HE HAD A SURER TEST OF DISTANCE I KNOW IT MUST BE FIVE AND TWENTY SAID HE BY THE TIME WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT IT IS NOW HALF AFTER ONE WE DROVE OUT OF THE INN YARD AT TETBURY AS THE TOWN CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN,15.675
92-204-0015,AND I DEFY ANY MAN IN ENGLAND TO MAKE MY HORSE GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR IN HARNESS THAT MAKES IT EXACTLY TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE LOST AN HOUR SAID MORLAND IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE CAME FROM TETBURY TEN O'CLOCK,14.9
92-204-0016,IT WAS ELEVEN UPON MY SOUL I COUNTED EVERY STROKE THIS BROTHER OF YOURS WOULD PERSUADE ME OUT OF MY SENSES MISS MORLAND DO BUT LOOK AT MY HORSE,10.225
92-204-0017,THE SERVANT HAD JUST MOUNTED THE CARRIAGE AND WAS DRIVING OFF SUCH TRUE BLOOD,5.2
92-204-0018,LOOK AT THAT CREATURE AND SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN HE DOES LOOK VERY HOT TO BE SURE HOT HE HAD NOT TURNED A HAIR TILL WE CAME TO WALCOT CHURCH,10.36
92-204-0019,LOOK AT HIS LOINS ONLY SEE HOW HE MOVES THAT HORSE CANNOT GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR TIE HIS LEGS AND HE WILL GET ON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY GIG MISS MORLAND,10.325
92-204-0020,HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT,4.475
92-204-0021,BUT I CHANCED TO MEET HIM ON MAGDALEN BRIDGE AS HE WAS DRIVING INTO OXFORD LAST TERM AH THORPE SAID HE DO YOU HAPPEN TO WANT SUCH A LITTLE THING AS THIS IT IS A CAPITAL ONE OF THE KIND BUT I AM CURSED TIRED OF IT,13.035
92-204-0022,AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE DID MISS MORLAND I AM SURE I CANNOT GUESS AT ALL CURRICLE HUNG YOU SEE SEAT TRUNK SWORD CASE SPLASHING BOARD LAMPS SILVER MOULDING ALL YOU SEE COMPLETE THE IRON WORK AS GOOD AS NEW OR BETTER,15.615
92-204-0023,HE ASKED FIFTY GUINEAS I CLOSED WITH HIM DIRECTLY THREW DOWN THE MONEY AND THE CARRIAGE WAS MINE AND I AM SURE SAID CATHERINE,8.575
92-204-0024,AND ON FINDING WHITHER THEY WERE GOING IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE GENTLEMEN SHOULD ACCOMPANY THEM TO EDGAR'S BUILDINGS AND PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO MISSUS THORPE JAMES AND ISABELLA LED THE WAY AND SO WELL SATISFIED WAS THE LATTER WITH HER LOT,14.385
92-204-0025,SO CONTENTEDLY WAS SHE ENDEAVOURING TO ENSURE A PLEASANT WALK TO HIM WHO BROUGHT THE DOUBLE RECOMMENDATION OF BEING HER BROTHER'S FRIEND AND HER FRIEND'S BROTHER SO PURE AND UNCOQUETTISH WERE HER FEELINGS THAT,12.625
92-204-0026,THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE,13.19
92-204-0027,RENEWED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS GIG YOU WILL FIND HOWEVER MISS MORLAND IT WOULD BE RECKONED A CHEAP THING BY SOME PEOPLE FOR I MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT FOR TEN GUINEAS MORE THE NEXT DAY JACKSON OF ORIEL BID ME SIXTY AT ONCE MORLAND WAS WITH ME AT THE TIME,14.64
92-204-0028,YES SAID MORLAND WHO OVERHEARD THIS BUT YOU FORGET THAT YOUR HORSE WAS INCLUDED MY HORSE,6.505
92-204-0029,I WOULD NOT SELL MY HORSE FOR A HUNDRED ARE YOU FOND OF AN OPEN CARRIAGE MISS MORLAND YES VERY I HAVE HARDLY EVER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN ONE BUT I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF IT I AM GLAD OF IT I WILL DRIVE YOU OUT IN MINE EVERY DAY,16.165
92-204-0030,THANK YOU SAID CATHERINE,1.91
92-204-0031,I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TOMORROW THANK YOU BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST REST HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TODAY ALL NONSENSE NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON,15.74
92-204-0032,NO NO I SHALL EXERCISE MINE AT THE AVERAGE OF FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY WHILE I AM HERE SHALL YOU INDEED SAID CATHERINE VERY SERIOUSLY,9.04
92-204-0033,FORTY AYE FIFTY FOR WHAT I CARE WELL I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN TOMORROW MIND I AM ENGAGED HOW DELIGHTFUL THAT WILL BE CRIED ISABELLA TURNING ROUND MY DEAREST CATHERINE I QUITE ENVY YOU,14.27
92-204-0034,A THIRD INDEED NO NO I DID NOT COME TO BATH TO DRIVE MY SISTERS ABOUT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD JOKE FAITH MORLAND MUST TAKE CARE OF YOU THIS BROUGHT ON A DIALOGUE OF CIVILITIES BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO,13.205
92-204-0035,BUT CATHERINE HEARD NEITHER THE PARTICULARS NOR THE RESULT HER COMPANION'S DISCOURSE NOW SUNK FROM ITS HITHERTO ANIMATED PITCH TO NOTHING MORE THAN A SHORT DECISIVE SENTENCE OF PRAISE OR CONDEMNATION ON THE FACE OF EVERY WOMAN THEY MET AND CATHERINE,14.815
92-204-0036,AFTER LISTENING AND AGREEING AS LONG AS SHE COULD WITH ALL THE CIVILITY AND DEFERENCE OF THE YOUTHFUL FEMALE MIND FEARFUL OF HAZARDING AN OPINION OF ITS OWN IN OPPOSITION TO THAT OF A SELF ASSURED MAN ESPECIALLY WHERE THE BEAUTY OF HER OWN SEX IS CONCERNED,15.18
92-204-0037,IT WAS HAVE YOU EVER READ UDOLPHO MISTER THORPE UDOLPHO OH LORD NOT I I NEVER READ NOVELS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO CATHERINE HUMBLED AND ASHAMED,11.945
92-204-0038,THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TOLERABLY DECENT ONE COME OUT SINCE TOM JONES EXCEPT THE MONK I READ THAT T'OTHER DAY BUT AS FOR ALL THE OTHERS THEY ARE THE STUPIDEST THINGS IN CREATION I THINK YOU MUST LIKE UDOLPHO IF YOU WERE TO READ IT IT IS SO VERY INTERESTING,14.545
92-204-0039,NOT I FAITH NO IF I READ ANY IT SHALL BE MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S HER NOVELS ARE AMUSING ENOUGH THEY ARE WORTH READING SOME FUN AND NATURE IN THEM UDOLPHO WAS WRITTEN BY MISSUS RADCLIFFE SAID CATHERINE,14.83
92-204-0040,WITH SOME HESITATION FROM THE FEAR OF MORTIFYING HIM NO SURE WAS IT AYE I REMEMBER SO IT WAS I WAS THINKING OF THAT OTHER STUPID BOOK WRITTEN BY THAT WOMAN THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SHE WHO MARRIED THE FRENCH EMIGRANT,16.32
92-204-0041,I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA YES,3.83
92-204-0042,I TOOK UP THE FIRST VOLUME ONCE AND LOOKED IT OVER BUT I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO INDEED I GUESSED WHAT SORT OF STUFF IT MUST BE BEFORE I SAW IT,9.04
92-204-0043,I HAVE NEVER READ IT YOU HAD NO LOSS I ASSURE YOU IT IS THE HORRIDEST NONSENSE YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD IN IT BUT AN OLD MAN'S PLAYING AT SEE SAW AND LEARNING LATIN UPON MY SOUL THERE IS NOT,14.46
92-204-0044,THIS CRITIQUE THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR CATHERINE BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MISSUS THORPE'S LODGINGS AND THE FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON,15.9
92-204-0045,AS THEY MET MISSUS THORPE WHO HAD DESCRIED THEM FROM ABOVE IN THE PASSAGE AH MOTHER HOW DO YOU DO SAID HE GIVING HER A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND WHERE DID YOU GET THAT QUIZ OF A HAT IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN OLD WITCH,15.4
92-204-0046,AND THIS ADDRESS,1.545
92-204-0047,FOR SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE MOST DELIGHTED AND EXULTING AFFECTION ON HIS TWO YOUNGER SISTERS HE THEN BESTOWED AN EQUAL PORTION OF HIS FRATERNAL TENDERNESS FOR HE ASKED EACH OF THEM HOW THEY DID,11.895
92-204-0048,THESE MANNERS DID NOT PLEASE CATHERINE BUT HE WAS JAMES'S FRIEND AND ISABELLA'S BROTHER AND HER JUDGMENT WAS FURTHER BOUGHT OFF BY ISABELLA'S ASSURING HER WHEN THEY WITHDREW TO SEE THE NEW HAT THAT JOHN THOUGHT HER THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD,13.93
92-204-0049,AND BY JOHN'S ENGAGING HER BEFORE THEY PARTED TO DANCE WITH HIM THAT EVENING HAD SHE BEEN OLDER OR VAINER SUCH ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE DONE LITTLE,9.68
92-204-0050,IT REQUIRES UNCOMMON STEADINESS OF REASON TO RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF BEING CALLED THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD,6.44
92-204-0051,AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS,1.795
92-204-0052,SET OFF TO WALK TOGETHER TO MISTER ALLEN'S AND JAMES AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON THEM SAID WELL CATHERINE HOW DO YOU LIKE MY FRIEND THORPE INSTEAD OF ANSWERING AS SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE HAD THERE BEEN NO FRIENDSHIP AND NO FLATTERY IN THE CASE I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL,15.85
92-204-0053,SHE DIRECTLY REPLIED I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH HE SEEMS VERY AGREEABLE HE IS AS GOOD NATURED A FELLOW AS EVER LIVED A LITTLE OF A RATTLE BUT THAT WILL RECOMMEND HIM TO YOUR SEX I BELIEVE AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE REST OF THE FAMILY,14.165
92-204-0054,VERY VERY MUCH INDEED ISABELLA PARTICULARLY,4.005
92-204-0055,SHE IS JUST THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMAN I COULD WISH TO SEE YOU ATTACHED TO SHE HAS SO MUCH GOOD SENSE AND IS SO THOROUGHLY UNAFFECTED AND AMIABLE I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO KNOW HER AND SHE SEEMS VERY FOND OF YOU SHE SAID THE HIGHEST THINGS IN YOUR PRAISE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE,14.9
92-204-0056,AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS THORPE EVEN YOU CATHERINE,3.57
92-204-0057,MAY BE PROUD OF INDEED I AM SHE REPLIED I LOVE HER EXCEEDINGLY AND AM DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT YOU LIKE HER TOO YOU HARDLY MENTIONED ANYTHING OF HER WHEN YOU WROTE TO ME AFTER YOUR VISIT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD SOON SEE YOU MYSELF,15.19
92-204-0058,I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER WHILE YOU ARE IN BATH SHE IS A MOST AMIABLE GIRL SUCH A SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING HOW FOND ALL THE FAMILY ARE OF HER SHE IS EVIDENTLY THE GENERAL FAVOURITE,11.705
92-204-0059,IS NOT SHE YES VERY MUCH INDEED I FANCY MISTER ALLEN THINKS HER THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN BATH I DARE SAY HE DOES AND I DO NOT KNOW ANY MAN WHO IS A BETTER JUDGE OF BEAUTY THAN MISTER ALLEN,12.82
92-204-0060,I NEED NOT ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE HAPPY HERE MY DEAR CATHERINE WITH SUCH A COMPANION AND FRIEND AS ISABELLA THORPE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BE OTHERWISE,8.31
92-204-0061,YES VERY KIND I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY BEFORE,4.05
92-204-0062,JAMES ACCEPTED THIS TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE AND QUALIFIED HIS CONSCIENCE FOR ACCEPTING IT TOO BY SAYING WITH PERFECT SINCERITY INDEED CATHERINE I LOVE YOU DEARLY,10.86
92-204-0063,THE SITUATION OF SOME THE GROWTH OF THE REST AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS NOW PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND CONTINUED WITH ONLY ONE SMALL DIGRESSION ON JAMES'S PART IN PRAISE OF MISS THORPE TILL THEY REACHED PULTENEY STREET,12.465
92-204-0064,WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH GREAT KINDNESS BY MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN INVITED BY THE FORMER TO DINE WITH THEM AND SUMMONED BY THE LATTER TO GUESS THE PRICE AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF A NEW MUFF AND TIPPET A PRE ENGAGEMENT IN EDGAR'S BUILDINGS,13.96
92-204-0065,PREVENTED HIS ACCEPTING THE INVITATION OF ONE FRIEND AND OBLIGED HIM TO HURRY AWAY AS SOON AS HE HAD SATISFIED THE DEMANDS OF THE OTHER,7.58
92-204-0066,BEING CORRECTLY ADJUSTED CATHERINE WAS THEN LEFT TO THE LUXURY OF A RAISED RESTLESS AND FRIGHTENED IMAGINATION OVER THE PAGES OF UDOLPHO,9.125
92-6488-0000,IF THE MAN HEARD HER HE GAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THE FACT HIS FACE WAS SET FORWARD AND HE WAS GUIDING THE HORSES WITH A FIRM UNQUIVERING HAND THE COACH RATTLED AND BOUNDED ALONG THE DANGEROUS WAY HEWN IN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,14.6049375
92-6488-0001,A MISSTEP OR A FALSE TURN MIGHT EASILY START THE CLUMSY VEHICLE ROLLING DOWN THE DECLIVITY ON THE RIGHT THE CONVICT WAS TAKING DESPERATE CHANCES AND WITH A COOL CALCULATING BRAIN PREPARED TO LEAP TO THE GROUND IN CASE OF ACCIDENT,14.6200625

94-3793-0018,PUT IT AWAY AND SAILED OUT OF THE ROOM NEKHLUDOFF OPENED THE PERFUMED NOTE AND BEGAN READING IT THE NOTE WAS WRITTEN ON A SHEET OF THICK GREY PAPER WITH ROUGH EDGES THE WRITING LOOKED ENGLISH,15.425
94-3793-0019,THIS NOTE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THAT SKILFUL MANOEUVRING WHICH THE PRINCESS KORCHAGIN HAD ALREADY PRACTISED FOR TWO MONTHS IN ORDER TO BIND HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER WITH INVISIBLE THREADS AND YET,14.415
94-3793-0020,BESIDE THE USUAL HESITATION OF MEN PAST THEIR YOUTH TO MARRY UNLESS THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE,7.23
94-3793-0021,HE COULD NOT PROPOSE AT ONCE IT WAS NOT THAT TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BETRAYED AND FORSAKEN MASLOVA HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THAT AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED IT A REASON FOR NOT MARRYING NO THE REASON WAS,16.005

94-3793-0025,AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO PROPOSE TO KORCHAGIN EVEN IF HE HAD WISHED TO DO SO AMONG THE LETTERS ON THE TABLE WAS ONE FROM THIS WOMAN'S HUSBAND SEEING HIS WRITING AND THE POSTMARK,14.83
94-3793-0026,NEKHLUDOFF FLUSHED AND FELT HIS ENERGIES AWAKENING AS THEY ALWAYS DID WHEN HE WAS FACING ANY KIND OF DANGER BUT HIS EXCITEMENT PASSED AT ONCE THE MARECHAL DO NOBLESSE OF THE DISTRICT IN WHICH HIS LARGEST ESTATE LAY,15.975

94-3793-0028,AT THE IMPORTANT DEBATES CONCERNING THE SCHOOLS AND THE ROADS AS A STRONG OPPOSITION BY THE REACTIONARY PARTY WAS EXPECTED THE MARECHAL WAS A LIBERAL AND WAS QUITE ENGROSSED IN THIS FIGHT,14.245
94-3793-0029,ALSO THE TERRIBLE SCENE HE HAD WITH HER WHEN SHE RAN OUT INTO THE PARK AND IN HER EXCITEMENT TRIED TO DROWN HERSELF IN THE POND,8.8700625

94-3793-0031,FOR HER OWN GOOD AS HE EXPRESSED IT TO THIS LETTER HE HAD AS YET RECEIVED NO ANSWER THIS MIGHT PROVE A GOOD SIGN,9.025
94-3793-0032,NEKHLUDOFF HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOME OFFICER WHO WAS PAYING HER MARKED ATTENTION AND THIS TORMENTED HIM BY AWAKENING JEALOUSY AND AT THE SAME TIME ENCOURAGED HIM WITH THE HOPE OF ESCAPE FROM THE DECEPTION THAT WAS OPPRESSING HIM,14.585
94-3793-0033,THE OTHER LETTER WAS FROM HIS STEWARD THE STEWARD WROTE TO TELL HIM THAT A VISIT TO HIS ESTATES WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENTER INTO POSSESSION AND ALSO TO DECIDE ABOUT THE FURTHER MANAGEMENT OF HIS LANDS,13.065
94-3793-0034,WHETHER IT WAS TO CONTINUE IN THE SAME WAY AS WHEN HIS MOTHER WAS ALIVE OR WHETHER AS HE HAD REPRESENTED TO THE LATE LAMENTED PRINCESS AND NOW ADVISED THE YOUNG PRINCE THEY HAD NOT BETTER INCREASE THEIR STOCK,13.635
94-3793-0035,AND FARM ALL THE LAND NOW RENTED BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES THE STEWARD WROTE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAR MORE PROFITABLE WAY OF MANAGING THE PROPERTY,9.73
94-3793-0036,DUE ON THE FIRST THIS MONEY WOULD BE SENT ON BY THE NEXT MAIL,4.77
94-3793-0037,THIS LETTER WAS PARTLY DISAGREEABLE AND PARTLY PLEASANT IT WAS PLEASANT TO FEEL THAT HE HAD POWER OVER SO LARGE A PROPERTY AND YET DISAGREEABLE,11.725
94-3793-0038,BECAUSE NEKHLUDOFF HAD BEEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER OF HENRY GEORGE AND HERBERT SPENCER BEING HIMSELF HEIR TO A LARGE PROPERTY HE WAS ESPECIALLY STRUCK BY THE POSITION TAKEN UP BY SPENCER IN SOCIAL STATICS,15.33
94-3793-0039,THAT JUSTICE FORBIDS PRIVATE LANDHOLDING AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD RESOLUTENESS OF HIS AGE HAD NOT MERELY SPOKEN TO PROVE THAT LAND COULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WRITTEN ESSAYS ON THAT SUBJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY,16.175
94-3793-0040,AND CONSIDERING IT WRONG TO HOLD LANDED PROPERTY,3.605
94-3793-0041,TO THE PEASANTS INHERITING HIS MOTHER'S LARGE ESTATES AND THUS BECOMING A LANDED PROPRIETOR HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER TO GIVE UP HIS PROPERTY AS HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS FATHER'S LAND TEN YEARS BEFORE,15.81
94-3793-0042,OR SILENTLY TO CONFESS THAT ALL HIS FORMER IDEAS WERE MISTAKEN AND FALSE HE COULD NOT CHOOSE THE FORMER BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS BUT THE LANDED ESTATES HE DID NOT CARE TO SERVE,14.945
94-3793-0043,MOREOVER HE HAD FORMED LUXURIOUS HABITS WHICH HE COULD NOT EASILY GIVE UP BESIDES HE HAD NO LONGER THE SAME INDUCEMENTS,9.135
94-3793-0044,WERE GONE AS TO THE SECOND COURSE THAT OF DENYING THOSE CLEAR AND UNANSWERABLE PROOFS OF THE INJUSTICE OF LANDHOLDING WHICH HE HAD DRAWN FROM SPENCER'S SOCIAL STATICS,12.8
94-3793-0045,AND THE BRILLIANT CORROBORATION OF WHICH HE HAD AT A LATER PERIOD FOUND IN THE WORKS OF HENRY GEORGE,6.115
94-3794-0000,MISSY WHEN NEKHLUDOFF HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO LOOK AT THE SUMMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME HE WAS TO APPEAR AT THE COURT BEFORE WRITING HIS ANSWER TO THE PRINCESS PASSING THROUGH HIS STUDIO,15.96
94-3794-0001,WHERE A FEW STUDIES HUNG ON THE WALLS AND FACING THE EASEL STOOD AN UNFINISHED PICTURE A FEELING OF INABILITY TO ADVANCE IN ART A SENSE OF HIS INCAPACITY CAME OVER HIM HE HAD OFTEN HAD THIS FEELING OF LATE,15.065
94-3794-0002,AND EXPLAINED IT BY HIS TOO FINELY DEVELOPED AESTHETIC TASTE STILL THE FEELING WAS A VERY UNPLEASANT ONE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THIS HE HAD GIVEN UP MILITARY SERVICE FEELING SURE THAT HE HAD A TALENT FOR ART,15.315
94-3794-0003,AND HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH SOME DISDAIN AT ALL OTHER ACTIVITY FROM THE HEIGHT OF HIS ARTISTIC STANDPOINT AND NOW IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF ALL THIS WAS UNPLEASANT,14.96
94-3794-0004,HE LOOKED AT THE LUXURIOUS FITTINGS OF THE STUDIO WITH A HEAVY HEART AND IT WAS IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD THAT HE ENTERED HIS STUDY A LARGE LOFTY ROOM FITTED UP WITH A VIEW TO COMFORT CONVENIENCE AND ELEGANT APPEARANCE,15.135
94-3794-0005,HE FOUND THE SUMMONS AT ONCE IN A PIGEON HOLE LABELLED IMMEDIATE OF HIS LARGE WRITING TABLE HE HAD TO APPEAR AT THE COURT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEKHLUDOFF SAT DOWN TO WRITE A NOTE IN REPLY TO THE PRINCESS,13.885
94-3794-0006,THANKING HER FOR THE INVITATION AND PROMISING TO TRY AND COME TO DINNER HAVING WRITTEN ONE NOTE HE TORE IT UP AS IT SEEMED TOO INTIMATE HE WROTE ANOTHER BUT IT WAS TOO COLD HE FEARED IT MIGHT GIVE OFFENCE SO HE TORE IT UP TOO,16.13
94-3794-0007,HE PRESSED THE BUTTON OF AN ELECTRIC BELL AND HIS SERVANT AN ELDERLY MOROSE LOOKING MAN WITH WHISKERS AND SHAVED CHIN AND LIP WEARING A GREY COTTON APRON ENTERED AT THE DOOR SEND TO FETCH AN ISVOSTCHIK PLEASE YES SIR,15.89
94-3794-0008,YES SIR IT IS NOT VERY POLITE BUT I CAN'T WRITE NO MATTER I SHALL SEE HER TODAY THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND WENT TO GET HIS OVERCOAT WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AN ISVOSTCHIK HE KNEW,13.79
94-3794-0009,WITH INDIA RUBBER TIRES TO HIS TRAP WAS AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR HIM,4.44
94-3794-0010,TURNING HALF ROUND WHEN I DROVE UP AND THE SWISS AT THE DOOR SAYS JUST GONE THE ISVOSTCHIK KNEW THAT NEKHLUDOFF VISITED AT THE KORCHAGINS AND CALLED THERE ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ENGAGED BY HIM,11.345
94-3794-0011,EVEN THE ISVOSTCHIKS KNOW OF MY RELATIONS WITH THE KORCHAGINS THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND AGAIN THE QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT MARRY PRINCESS KORCHAGIN PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM AND HE COULD NOT DECIDE IT EITHER WAY,13.31
94-3794-0012,ANY MORE THAN MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THIS TIME IT WAS IN FAVOUR OF MARRIAGE IN GENERAL THAT BESIDES THE COMFORTS OF HEARTH AND HOME IT MADE A MORAL LIFE POSSIBLE AND CHIEFLY THAT A FAMILY WOULD,15.445
94-3794-0013,AGAINST MARRIAGE IN GENERAL WAS THE FEAR COMMON TO BACHELORS PAST THEIR FIRST YOUTH OF LOSING FREEDOM AND AN UNCONSCIOUS AWE BEFORE THIS MYSTERIOUS CREATURE A WOMAN,13.27
94-3794-0014,IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IN FAVOUR OF MARRYING MISSY HER NAME WAS MARY BUT AS IS USUAL AMONG A CERTAIN SET A NICKNAME HAD BEEN GIVEN HER WAS THAT SHE CAME OF GOOD FAMILY AND DIFFERED IN EVERYTHING,14.38
94-3794-0015,MANNER OF SPEAKING WALKING LAUGHING FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE NOT BY ANYTHING EXCEPTIONAL BUT BY HER GOOD BREEDING HE COULD FIND NO OTHER TERM FOR THIS QUALITY THOUGH HE PRIZED IT VERY HIGHLY,14.025
94-3794-0016,THEREFORE EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD HIM THIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIM,4.91
94-3794-0017,WAS TO NEKHLUDOFF A PROOF OF HER GOOD SENSE AND CORRECT JUDGMENT AGAINST MARRYING MISSY IN PARTICULAR WAS THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GIRL WITH EVEN HIGHER QUALITIES COULD BE FOUND THAT SHE WAS ALREADY TWENTY SEVEN,15.725
94-3794-0018,AND THAT HE WAS HARDLY HER FIRST LOVE THIS LAST IDEA WAS PAINFUL TO HIM HIS PRIDE WOULD NOT RECONCILE ITSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD LOVED SOME ONE ELSE EVEN IN THE PAST,12.8
94-3794-0019,OF COURSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE SHOULD MEET HIM BUT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANOTHER OFFENDED HIM SO THAT HE HAD AS MANY REASONS FOR MARRYING AS AGAINST IT AT ANY RATE THEY WEIGHED EQUALLY WITH NEKHLUDOFF,15.615
94-3794-0020,WHO LAUGHED AT HIMSELF AND CALLED HIMSELF THE ASS OF THE FABLE REMAINING LIKE THAT ANIMAL UNDECIDED WHICH HAYCOCK TO TURN TO AT ANY RATE BEFORE I GET AN ANSWER FROM MARY VASILIEVNA,13.445
94-3794-0021,THE MARECHAL'S WIFE AND FINISH COMPLETELY WITH HER I CAN DO NOTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THE CONVICTION THAT HE MIGHT AND WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO DELAY HIS DECISION WAS COMFORTING WELL,13.66
94-3794-0022,I SHALL CONSIDER ALL THAT LATER ON HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS THE TRAP DROVE SILENTLY ALONG THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT UP TO THE DOORS OF THE COURT NOW I MUST FULFIL MY PUBLIC DUTIES CONSCIENTIOUSLY AS I AM IN THE HABIT OF ALWAYS DOING,15.58
94-3795-0000,THE ATTENDANTS HURRIED OUT OF BREATH DRAGGING THEIR FEET ALONG THE GROUND WITHOUT LIFTING THEM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH ALL SORTS OF MESSAGES AND PAPERS,9.755
94-3795-0001,PASSED HITHER AND THITHER PLAINTIFFS AND THOSE OF THE ACCUSED WHO WERE NOT GUARDED WANDERED SADLY ALONG THE WALLS OR SAT WAITING WHERE IS THE LAW COURT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED OF AN ATTENDANT,13.065

94-3795-0007,NEKHLUDOFF GAVE HIS NAME AND PASSED INTO THE JURYMEN'S ROOM INSIDE THE ROOM WERE ABOUT TEN PERSONS OF ALL SORTS THEY HAD COME BUT A SHORT WHILE AGO AND SOME WERE SITTING OTHERS WALKING UP AND DOWN,14.38
94-3795-0008,LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND MAKING EACH OTHER'S ACQUAINTANCE THERE WAS A RETIRED COLONEL IN UNIFORM SOME WERE IN FROCK COATS OTHERS IN MORNING COATS AND ONLY ONE WORE A PEASANT'S DRESS,12.015
94-3795-0009,THEIR FACES ALL HAD A CERTAIN LOOK OF SATISFACTION AT THE PROSPECT OF FULFILLING A PUBLIC DUTY ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM HAD HAD TO LEAVE THEIR BUSINESSES AND MOST WERE COMPLAINING OF IT THE JURYMEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES ABOUT THE WEATHER,15.145
94-3795-0010,THE EARLY SPRING AND THE BUSINESS BEFORE THEM SOME HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED OTHERS JUST GUESSING WHO WAS WHO THOSE WHO WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH NEKHLUDOFF MADE HASTE TO GET INTRODUCED EVIDENTLY LOOKING UPON THIS AS AN HONOUR,14.495
94-3795-0011,AND HE TAKING IT AS HIS DUE AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN AMONG STRANGERS HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHY HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ABOVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN AN ANSWER,11.97
94-3795-0012,THE FACT OF HIS SPEAKING ENGLISH FRENCH AND GERMAN WITH A GOOD ACCENT,4.605
94-3795-0013,BOUGHT FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE DEALERS IN THESE GOODS HE QUITE KNEW WOULD NOT SERVE AS A REASON FOR CLAIMING SUPERIORITY AT THE SAME TIME HE DID CLAIM SUPERIORITY AND ACCEPTED THE RESPECT PAID HIM AS HIS DUE,15.405
94-3795-0014,AND WAS HURT IF HE DID NOT GET IT IN THE JURYMEN'S ROOM HIS FEELINGS WERE HURT BY DISRESPECTFUL TREATMENT AMONG THE JURY THERE HAPPENED TO BE A MAN WHOM HE KNEW A FORMER TEACHER OF HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN PETER GERASIMOVITCH,16.065

94-3795-0016,HIS VULGARITY IN SHORT AH HA YOU'RE ALSO TRAPPED THESE WERE THE WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER WITH WHICH PETER GERASIMOVITCH GREETED NEKHLUDOFF HAVE YOU NOT MANAGED TO GET OUT OF IT,14.535

94-3795-0018,IN RUSSIAN AS IN MANY OTHER LANGUAGES THOU IS USED GENERALLY AMONG PEOPLE VERY FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER OR BY SUPERIORS TO INFERIORS,8.55
94-3795-0019,AND WALKED AWAY WITH SUCH A LOOK OF SADNESS ON HIS FACE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN NATURAL IF HE HAD JUST HEARD OF THE DEATH OF ALL HIS RELATIONS HE CAME UP TO A GROUP THAT HAD FORMED ITSELF ROUND A CLEAN SHAVEN TALL DIGNIFIED MAN,15.23
94-3795-0020,WHO WAS RECOUNTING SOMETHING WITH GREAT ANIMATION THIS MAN WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TRIAL GOING ON IN THE CIVIL COURT AS OF A CASE WELL KNOWN TO HIMSELF MENTIONING THE JUDGES AND A CELEBRATED ADVOCATE BY NAME,13.845
94-3795-0021,HE WAS SAYING THAT IT SEEMED WONDERFUL HOW THE CELEBRATED ADVOCATE HAD MANAGED TO GIVE SUCH A CLEVER TURN TO THE AFFAIR THAT AN OLD LADY THOUGH SHE HAD THE RIGHT ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE TO PAY A LARGE SUM TO HER OPPONENT,14.1
94-3795-0022,THE ADVOCATE IS A GENIUS HE SAID THE LISTENERS HEARD IT ALL WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION AND SEVERAL OF THEM TRIED TO PUT IN A WORD BUT THE MAN INTERRUPTED THEM AS IF HE ALONE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT,14.065
94-3795-0023,THOUGH NEKHLUDOFF HAD ARRIVED LATE HE HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME,4.605
